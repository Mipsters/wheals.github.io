                                    Yes, I&#39;m working on it now, among other things. It&#39;s nice to hear you like the idea.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The flash stuff will be handled in a way that graphic novels have been
                                    effectively conveying dramatic action for a long time. Through
                                    sequential art.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    A number of people seem to have trouble with the concept of a book
                                    adaptation, almost to the point where the idea of the object existing
                                    somewhere in reality offends them. It seems some would prefer it not
                                    exist at all, even if it means denying it from those who really want a
                                    book adaptation despite the obvious cross-media challenges. If we were
                                    all supremely literal people by equal measure, we would all demand a DVD
                                    treatment or something similar, with all the music and animation intact
                                    as it is on the web. However, some people like books. They like a
                                    physical, tactile object that you can take off a shelf, flip through and
                                    read, without turning something on or glaring at a screen for hours.
                                    This is why books still exist, and why we haven&#39;t decided to burn down
                                    our libraries quite yet.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Taking such strong issue with adaptation from one form of media to
                                    another is puzzling to me. It happens all the time. Books are adapted to
                                    movies, and back. Musicals become films, films become games, games
                                    become comics. Stories have many ways they can be told. If someone were
                                    going to make a graphic novel out of a movie, imagine how absurd it
                                    would be to ask the artist, &quot;Oh yeah? How are you going to handle all
                                    the moving around bits? Like, all that motion that happens in movies?
                                    Oh, what about the MUSIC??&quot; The objection is actually profoundly
                                    idiotic, but we don&#39;t actually hear people raise such qualms with these
                                    sorts of adaptations, probably because they are known quantities. We
                                    know what a book-to-film adaptation is like. It&#39;s a Thing. Bringing
                                    Homestuck into static media is not a Thing, because I essentially
                                    invented the original format. This probably messes with people&#39;s heads
                                    on the issue somewhat. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I guess part of it is that craving absolute purity and fidelity from an
                                    adaptation is a hallmark of the zealously devoted. That&#39;s fine, but
                                    isn&#39;t really a point of view I cotton to. It&#39;s very rigid, very linear,
                                    and those demands are ironically antithetical to the spirit behind HS&#39;s
                                    creation, and all those crazy things that allegedly won&#39;t cross over to
                                    print. So you say HS &quot;absolutely cannot exist in a book?&quot; If I had much
                                    concern for what a story absolutely could or couldn&#39;t be, I wouldn&#39;t
                                    have even made it in the first place. Imagine again a movie with all its
                                    motion and sound becoming a graphic novel, and how reasonable this
                                    endeavor is. What if the hyper-zealous nerd has concerns that the novel
                                    won&#39;t be able to capture all of this FEELING and EMOTION from the scenes
                                    that the pacing and sound evoked through perfect, literal duplication
                                    in print? Well, it won&#39;t. It&#39;s not supposed to, and it&#39;s a completely
                                    unreasonable expectation to have for the adaptation. It will be a
                                    different angle on the work, and that&#39;s fine. It&#39;s great, in fact. It
                                    should be what you want from an adaptation. If you want to re-experience
                                    exactly what you felt in its original form, then you may go enjoy it in
                                    its original form again. That&#39;s why it&#39;s there.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The funny thing is, all the types of adaptations I mentioned, like
                                    book-to-film, are very major departures in format. A Homestuck book
                                    actually comes quite close to representing the original work by
                                    comparison, because after all, HS is at least 95% mostly-static panels,
                                    with text underneath. Anyone who says that&#39;s outrageously unfit for
                                    print is being quite extreme. As a whole, the thing is basically a great
                                    big comic. A comic with a few perks the web affords.

                                    This suggestion has come up a million times, even before I did
                                    the PS books and people were wondering how those were going to work with
                                    all the animation, or if they even COULD work. (Fast forward to now,
                                    those books went off without a hitch and they&#39;re totally sweet!)<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Embedding a flipbook in an HS book couldn&#39;t be anything more than a
                                    novelty. Some little thing you stick in the corner, turn the whole book
                                    to the side, and flip through the pages. It would allow for very little
                                    meaningful animation to be presented.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Basically, if this suggestion is serious, my response is: man, that is
                                    sooo literal. It&#39;s not a reasonable way to show animation in a book that
                                    also tells a mostly unanimated story, and it doesn&#39;t solve a problem
                                    which isn&#39;t even really a problem.

                                    This ancestor interlude is a little religious tale. Over the course of
                                    the story sometimes we wander into these silly mini-genres, like
                                    &quot;horrorstuck&quot;, or erotic historical fiction through Mindfang&#39;s journal
                                    entries. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The Jesus parallel is pretty blatant, down to the use of the torture
                                    device as the symbol for the religious movement (cross, irons). I
                                    personally think the explanation of the relevance of Karkat&#39;s sign is
                                    one of the more interesting aspects about it, just from the perspective
                                    of taking existing symbols and adapting them to an evolving mythological
                                    framework. Segments like this aren&#39;t really just about &quot;Gee, the
                                    ancestors sure are cool, let&#39;s hear more about them.&quot; (Though there&#39;s no
                                    question there&#39;s a certain amount of fan service in play when I do
                                    stuff like this.) We learn more about the story and characters and
                                    answer questions beyond the limited scope of their biographies, like why
                                    Karkat had a sign at all if he had no caste.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    We learn more about the troll race, as a once peaceful species and such
                                    before kid-ancestors as players scratched their session, though the
                                    short term relevance of this is mainly as a preamble to Scratch&#39;s
                                    religious story. Establishing an Eden-like paradise from which there is
                                    some departure through sin is sort of the boilerplate basis for
                                    religious lore. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Scratch is a devil figure about as blatant as the Sufferer is a Christ
                                    figure. The failed players from peaceful Alternia made a classic &quot;deal
                                    with the devil&quot; move by causing the scratch after being given a choice
                                    by the mother of all monsters. (Echidna. Hey, she&#39;s a big snake!) By
                                    doing so they brought Scratch into their universe, and therefore all the
                                    things you&#39;d expect that comes with summoning the devil. This resulted
                                    not only turning Alternia into a planet full of violent murderers, but
                                    it only technically granted them what they wanted with a huge caveat, as
                                    is the case with such ill-advised bargains. The players were strong
                                    enough to win, but made a terminal universe, were barred from entry,
                                    hunted by a demon, and then started killing each other. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    &quot;Old Scratch&quot; is actually an old timey nickname for the devil. It&#39;s used
                                    in some Twain books. The manipulative devil figure pulling the strings
                                    was always the basis for his character, and this was probably pretty
                                    obvious right away. He&#39;s part devil/puppet/cueball, with a dash of the
                                    old gambler/gunslinger Doc Holliday in his profile. Doc Holliday is
                                    actually my ancestor. He is related to me on my mother&#39;s side, who&#39;s
                                    last name is also Holliday.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Hopefully I won&#39;t die at age 36 of tuberculosis though. If there&#39;s
                                    anything to the karmic fortune-swapping of the trolls and their
                                    ancestors, ideally tuberculosis will die of me.

                                    The pantskat gag has been reiterated a few times now. The first
                                    time (I think was the fedorafreak log?) was just a dumb little shoutout.
                                    Subsequent times was essentially for the benefit of archive readers who
                                    wouldn&#39;t understand or even notice the reference. Repetition ossifies
                                    it as a running gag, so instead of it going over their heads the first
                                    time, a few gags later they start to ask, hey what&#39;s with these
                                    references to guys wearing tall pants?<br>
                                    <br>
                                    It is to their benefit, by which I mean, does not improve their understanding of the

                                    He amplified John&#39;s fears in his dream to take the form of a voodoo doll

                                    made his dad think he was into clowns. So his dad began collecting
                                    harlequins believing he was sharing in John&#39;s interests.<br>

                                    He then got him the big harlequin doll for his birthday. The doll was maimed, lost
                                    an arm and an eye, and was prototyped.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The clown prototyping caused Jack to become especially angry at the
                                    queen over the new dress code. All of this lead to big problems.

                                    It&#39;s not clear that he is getting in touch with his in-game
                                    powers, like John did with the windy thing, or whether withdrawing from
                                    his sopor slime haze is bringing out psychic powers he would have had
                                    anyway.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The latter would make sense for his bloodline though. If this were a
                                    common ability among subjugglators, it would help explain why they&#39;re
                                    able to hold power over all lower classes.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    It&#39;s implied that they&#39;re very strong and dangerous, in addition to
                                    being insane and unpredictable. But this by itself doesn&#39;t necessarily
                                    explain why they&#39;d be able to keep power over such a huge population of
                                    similarly dangerous trolls, which also have many deadly powers.
                                    Especially since, also implied, the higher the blood, the longer they
                                    live. This means lower classes must be much more copious than higher
                                    classes. The lowbloods die off much more quickly, and so must be spawned
                                    in greater numbers. Those with high longevity can&#39;t afford to be
                                    spawned in such numbers, or the population would be out of control. At
                                    the top of the hierarchy is the Empress, who lives for thousands of
                                    years. There is only one of her class, discounting her successor.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    For the subjugglators in their small numbers to keep such a large
                                    population under their control, it would be very useful to have the
                                    ability to psychically amplify fears through dreams. They may have
                                    directed their chucklevoodoos on every susceptible mind in the
                                    population. Each lowblood may have a little highblood voodoo doll
                                    lurking in their subconscious, making them too terrified to organize any
                                    sort of rebellion. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Additional notes:<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Now knowing he had this ability, we can wonder whether he used it during
                                    his rampage, in addition to using it on John/Dave. Did he use the
                                    ability to befuddle Terezi into pinning the crime on Vriska in spite of
                                    laughably overwhelming evidence to the contrary? Turning Terezi against
                                    Vriska was likely the only way he could kill Vriska, due to her cerebral
                                    &quot;luck neutralizing&quot; ability. Did he exaggerate Karkat&#39;s fears to
                                    destabilize the team? What about Equius? Maybe he exaggerated his fear
                                    of failing to show a superior deference, to the point of incapacitation.

                                    Scratch keeps Aradia (???) locked up in a room with a 5th wall.
                                    She turned it on and tried to break it, presumably to attempt to escape.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Through the 5th wall, you can see me positioning two 4th walls facing
                                    each other, exactly one yard apart. English&#39;s coat is still draped over
                                    one. I put that there a while ago to obscure Jade&#39;s view of me.
                                    Remember?<br>
                                    <br>
                                    A 4th wall is an object that when broken or compromised, allows an
                                    author to interact directly with the audience or characters in the
                                    story.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    A 5th wall is a partition separating two omniscient narrators, which when broken,
                                    allows them to mess with each other.<br>

                                    I will happen to be in the area over the weekend for unrelated
                                    reasons, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to pony up the 80 bucks or whatever

                                    behind HS cosplayers while they take photos of each other, and then
                                    quickly vanish into the scenery. <br>

                                    I&#39;m suddenly not sure which idea is more amusing. Actually doing that,
                                    or the fact that by saying so here, I have guaranteed that all HS
                                    cosplayers will be nervously looking over their shoulders all weekend.

                                    The page rate is deceptively slow when you zoom in on a select
                                    few days. There was a 6 day pause, then 13 pages went up. So that&#39;s
                                    about 2 pages per day, which is &quot;slow&quot;, right? But then you wait a few
                                    more days, and 23 pages have stacked up, and suddenly that rate jumps to
                                    4 pages per day, which is close to the site average. And if you examine
                                    the period between now and 10 days ago, the rate is almost 8 pages per
                                    day, which is way above average. It&#39;s better to think of the output in
                                    longer term averages. This is harder for those who demand regularity and
                                    predictability, which is something you get from some comics which
                                    update once every weekday, or m/w/f, without fail as part of their
                                    product delivery pledge. In these cases, the regularity of the output
                                    strikes me as being almost as important, and sometimes more important,
                                    than the quality of the content itself. This is because people are
                                    creatures of habit, and have a strong craving for reliability. Many will
                                    quite happily absorb work they consider to be fairly mediocre as long
                                    as it is cranked out like clockwork. The sunday funnies is probably a
                                    good long term example of this. Millions of people gobbled up decades of
                                    Marmaduke without ever laughing once, but editors wouldn&#39;t dare fuck
                                    with Marmaduke because people needed that shit with their coffee for
                                    some reason. You could put a gun to their head and they couldn&#39;t tell
                                    you why. There is comfort in even bland routine. If you mess with
                                    people&#39;s comfort and destabilize certain regularities in their universe,
                                    they become agitated, even angry. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Now, if people actually have any sort of passion for the entertainment
                                    comprising their routine, then they become even more agitated if the
                                    output is disturbed. Passionate interest severely exacerbates the
                                    situation, and can make a creator envy someone like Marmaduke Guy who
                                    spent his career crouching safely in mediocrity, grinding out awful dog
                                    comics everyone became totally comfortable with disliking. (I bet he
                                    never got an angry letter from an anime fan.) But if you mess with the
                                    schedule of material that people zealously crave, they are not merely
                                    irked, but can receive it as a personal affront from the author. This is
                                    true in varying degrees for probably most enthusiastic readers, but is
                                    more pronounced by the degree to which a person is mentally ill. <br>

                                    There are some particularly unpleasant entities out there who pose
                                    questions similar to yours, but much less politely. These are seemingly
                                    self appointed watchdogs for my page rate, and I think I&#39;m safe in
                                    assuming most are severely under-medicated teens with a bigtime beef
                                    about You Fucking Name It. As torrid a pace as Homestuck has been
                                    unloaded on the public, I think it must have been pretty easy for some
                                    spoiled children to factor that rate of output into the entitlement
                                    complex which presides over their central nervous systems. Deviation
                                    from that production schedule in the minds of the entitled means nothing
                                    other than offense committed by the author, or more generously, just a
                                    staggering display of laziness. Never mind that the alleged deviation
                                    may not even QUITE exist (see numbers in first paragraph). But if it
                                    did, I wonder whose rate of production they would compare it to, aside
                                    from some foggy recollection of my own? <br>

                                    For such people, what would probably be useful would be a dose of
                                    perspective. Not that they&#39;re likely to read this, but let&#39;s consider
                                    the following data anyway, kindly provided by tvtropes.com.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    <a class="nofollow" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WebcomicsLongRunners" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WebcomicsLongRunners</a><br>
                                    <br>
                                    MSPA is the longest web comic on record, in terms of update quantity. It
                                    accumulated most of this content in about 3 years. Now consider that
                                    the second comic on the list is approximately THE OLDEST WEB COMIC IN
                                    EXISTENCE. It dates back to 1995, which for all intents and purposes was
                                    the year the internet was born. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    There are of course some mitigating factors. Most MSPA updates are a
                                    single panel, with some accompanying text. But there are some
                                    counter-caveats which make this a bit more difficult to process. There
                                    are several hours of animated Flash footage mixed in with the updates.
                                    There are several more hours of interactive gameplay. Each Flash
                                    instance occupies a single update. Many updates are accompanied by
                                    several pages of dialogue. Some of these individual conversations would
                                    take up 50 pages worth of speech bubbles in a graphic novel. The total
                                    word count for MSPA likely exceeds most of the comics on that list, or
                                    possibly all of them. It wouldn&#39;t be surprising. Homestuck alone is over
                                    300K words. Again, this effort was compressed into the last 3 years,
                                    while most of the other comics date back to the 90&#39;s.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    What does this mean? Here is what it means.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Let&#39;s imagine MSPA was distributed more like a &quot;normal comic&quot;. Where,
                                    even with a healthy update schedule of 7 days a week, you still only get
                                    one new thing to click on. One update per day. It could be a simple
                                    panel with a silly gag and no text. Could be a panel with 10 pages of
                                    dialogue beneath it. Or it could be a 3 minute flash animation. All are
                                    things that appear in the archive in good supply. Distributing one such
                                    thing per day, as the designated &quot;product&quot;, would be a completely
                                    reasonable policy. If that were the established pattern from the start,
                                    nobody would think it was remotely inappropriate, and nobody would ask
                                    for more, in the same way that nobody ever demands that Penny Arcade
                                    update 7 days a week instead of 3.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    If that were the case, MSPA would now have 16 years worth of content. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    So what does THIS mean??<br>
                                    <br>
                                    It means, given that I started 3 years ago, I could take a 13 year break
                                    starting now, and at the end of that break, MSPA&#39;s lifetime rate of
                                    production would still manage to make the lifetime rate of most other
                                    comics seem underwhelming. This is literally, actually true, even though
                                    it sounds like a joke. There is statistical evidence to support this,
                                    using the only data that matters, which is the existing work of peers in
                                    the same field.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    So if some twerp who&#39;s never put a stretch of hard work into anything
                                    aside from grinding for levels in WoW all weekend decides to get on my

                                    I&#39;m not really thinking about which style is better. Mainly what
                                    matters here is the idea doesn&#39;t work unless I post a large amount of
                                    content at once. So that&#39;s what I do.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I&#39;m sure there are differences in the reading experience. Some may find
                                    it more gratifying to read a lot at once. It certainly consolidates
                                    impact, which is something that is often lost through the slow, steady
                                    serial drip. But they may also find it frustrating to wait longer for
                                    the pages to stack up. It may provoke the feeling that output is slowing
                                    down, or grinding to a halt.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    This is not actually true though. After the 6 day pause, 41 pages were
                                    posted. That&#39;s about 7 pages per day, which is higher than the site&#39;s
                                    lifetime average of 5 pages per day. It&#39;s actually a hot streak!

                                    For those that don&#39;t know, Rose&#39;s house as well as a few other locations have
                                    concrete GPS coordinates in the real world.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Her house is located here, over a real waterfall called Rainbow Falls in the

                                    Kind of an odd place for a house. But then, it&#39;s an unusual house.
                                    Sticking a secret lab in some remote place in a huge nature preserve
                                    might make some sense.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Jade&#39;s location is even more remote.<br>

                                    John&#39;s house is an actual house. It was for sale at one point. Don&#39;t know if it
                                    still is. It&#39;s just below Pipe Lake.<br>
                                    <br>

                                    Nah, I was mostly useless on the road. I eked out those two pages preceding this

                                    Not Bard Quest necessarily, just taking advantage of the fact
                                    that I built the site from the beginning to allow branching paths, even
                                    if they all wind up back at the same place. Every other story does this.
                                    BQ obviously, Jailbreak has one fork that converges again, and Problem
                                    sleuth uses a couple really quick offshoots to handle deaths and other
                                    fuck-ups.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Aside from that, one of the main points of the Scratch segment was not
                                    only to slip into a different gear with respect to story pacing, but to
                                    introduce a vehicle to explore new methods for engaging with events in a
                                    story which has accrued a vast amount of detail and complexity. The
                                    consequence has been a little more detachment from the events directly
                                    as we experience some mediation between us and the characters through
                                    this host. But what comes with that bit of extra distance from the
                                    story, and bringing to fore its features as a work of metafiction, are
                                    these devices for accessing this complex story which wouldn&#39;t make sense
                                    to introduce without letting this segment build some momentum.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Telling the story in parallel through the header images was an example
                                    of that potential, and tying together the themes in the header with the
                                    main content was one of the interesting challenges. And of course the
                                    narrator himself is a character with a role in the story, so as he tells
                                    the story he is advancing his own role in it as well. A lot more is
                                    being advanced at the same time, in a way that I think is fun and in the
                                    spirit of everything on the site. The scrapbook thing is another
                                    example, a way of utilizing some of these silly meta-story devices which
                                    at first appear to be mocking the format itself, but become another
                                    useful gateway into a bunch of different threads of the story at once.
                                    Of course you read those threads one at a time, but the feeling is that
                                    they&#39;re being accessed in parallel. Using parallel story telling devices
                                    seemed like an interesting way to address what has become a formidable
                                    number of threads to keep track of, and also a fun way to give some
                                    forgotten details a little more attention which would seem like a pretty
                                    frivolous diversion otherwise (like Nepeta talking to Jaspers), while
                                    still finding a way to give them a little relevance to the current
                                    storylines. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    In a way the Scratch segment has been like busting open a pinata of
                                    different storytelling devices and seeing what&#39;s there to work with. And
                                    he sort of did that literally when he broke the scrapbook over Slick&#39;s
                                    head, releasing all the clippings from the story, both old and new.
                                    Having them strewn about the place is another semi-mocking
                                    acknowledgement of the nature of the story, a thing which has dissolved
                                    into absolute nonlinearity, where looking into a panel at any point in
                                    time, past present or future, reality memory dream or afterlife, is
                                    something which can advance the plot. Because it advances not just
                                    through unfolding action, but by what previously concealed information
                                    is exposed, and how it&#39;s presented. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    This was actually one of the reasons for devising the dream bubble
                                    system. It serves a purpose in the plot, yes, but it also has flexible
                                    narrative utility. The dream bubbles allow moments of the past to be
                                    explored, or moments of an alternate timeline, through memories of
                                    characters in such a way that it doesn&#39;t have to be a strict flashback,
                                    can be invested with more immediate relevance to what&#39;s going on, and
                                    allows a way for characters to talk about it. (Remember, rules for when
                                    dialogue is allowed are pretty strict! Dream bubbles amended the rules
                                    such that characters can converse directly when dreaming or dead. This
                                    is because the segments begin as memories consisting of online
                                    conversations, and continue from there.) It was a more effective way to
                                    convey Cal&#39;s final journey and Scratch&#39;s origin, for instance. And it
                                    again becomes a useful tool when examining a clipping on the floor of an
                                    obscure event in the past. We enter the panel somewhat like the
                                    characters do, seeing it as a memory of something that&#39;s already
                                    happened, but the scene evolves as the characters remember, and soon
                                    through their interaction it catches up with the current state of the
                                    story and contributes to it. Other clippings are played a little more
                                    straight, like we are briefly entering a window to another parallel
                                    event, then moving on. Either way, going into his clippings momentarily
                                    reconnects us directly with the story rather than experiencing it
                                    through his mediation. But then, the mediation allowed us to do this in
                                    the first place. There&#39;ll probably be a few more of these scrapbook
                                    gateways before we&#39;re done with them.

                                    Wait, it&#39;s this question again! The exact same question, what are the odds. It&#39;s
                                    like the question&#39;s ghost or something.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I agree that dropping from 16 to 8 characters leaves the story direly
                                    under-staffed. I mean when it was down to 14 that was already pretty
                                    sketchy territory. People were asking &quot;can hussie REALLY finish a story
                                    with only 14 main characters? i know he&#39;s good, but is that even
                                    POSSIBLE?&quot; 8 is practically a skeleton crew!<br>

                                    But don&#39;t worry, help is on the way. Soon I will launch the lengthy
                                    squiddle intermission, documenting the tale of the 48 heroic squiddles
                                    who played in the session which created the troll universe. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    At first, people will bemoan this drastic departure from the &quot;real
                                    story&quot; and wonder when we can get back to Homestuck proper. But over
                                    time, you will grow to love each squiddle dearly. Each will be more
                                    exquisitely characterized than the last, and it is only then, when you
                                    have welcomed them into your hearts, will the ruthless culling begin. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Then we&#39;ll get back to the trolls and you&#39;ll be like fuck these guys.<br>

                                    I&#39;m not hesitant about following through with long term plans I made.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Most of these characters didn&#39;t exist a year ago. Vriska was introduced
                                    in July last year. I opened these arcs understanding most of them would
                                    likely be closed, and every gesture has paved the way for what you see
                                    now. Act five has been a great swelling of cast complexity followed by a
                                    great contraction. I knew it was going to have this overall structure. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Another approach would have been to treat this cast like that of a
                                    syndicated cartoon, with amusing but basically static lives. Antics
                                    happen, hijinks are afoot, everyone is pals and things are ok forever.
                                    Tune in next week! I don&#39;t deny there&#39;s entertainment value in that,
                                    with the content leaning on characters and relationships above anything
                                    else. This is actually the reality of this work echoed by the collective
                                    consciousness of fan artists, who cast all these characters in a
                                    perma-living state playing out amusing scenarios with each other. It&#39;s
                                    fun. Doesn&#39;t serve the bigger story much! Not one with a complex
                                    architecture headed in a very specific direction, but fun nonetheless.
                                    It would be prioritizing character far beyond the overarching story. I&#39;m
                                    not doing that. Certainly not with characters always designed to play a
                                    transient role.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The bottom line is, I had plans, and I stuck to them. I wouldn&#39;t change
                                    them midstream because I got the sense that some people would rather
                                    Homestuck be &quot;Trolls! The Sitcom.&quot;

                                    The story provides no conclusive answer to this, and I
                                    personally cannot provide the scoop either. Not that I am withholding it
                                    to be coy, but to take my word for it one way or another would be
                                    missing the point. The destruction of the clock is another element among
                                    many for you to weigh when considering these events.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    First, there&#39;s the consideration of whether her death was just, heroic,
                                    or neither. The clock appeared to be leaning toward &quot;just&quot;, when it was
                                    interrupted by the crowbar. Maybe it would have landed there. Or if
                                    given the chance, maybe it would have swung back and settled somewhere
                                    else. We don&#39;t have a definitive ruling. All we know for sure is she&#39;s
                                    dead.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    So we can conclude that either: <br>
                                    <br>
                                    1) The clock itself has no bearing on her life directly, much as clocks
                                    merely measure time without influencing it. Which would mean if given
                                    the chance it definitely would have landed on either just or heroic, but
                                    not in the middle. The proof is her death.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    or <br>
                                    <br>
                                    2) The result of the clock does have direct bearing on her life, and by
                                    knocking the clock over so that it stuck on &quot;just&quot;, Slick inadvertently
                                    killed her for good, regardless of where it may have landed. But to be
                                    fair, if he knew it was going to kill her, he might be hitting it
                                    harder. You could consider it delayed revenge for his exile, which
                                    Vriska and Snowman coordinated. It&#39;s safe to assume Slick would have
                                    found her death to be quite just, and may have been weighing in on the
                                    matter through circumstantial serendipity.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    If 2) is true, there is another wrinkle to consider. Recall that the
                                    crowbar he is using (from the intermission) has the property of being
                                    able to nullify the effect of whatever &quot;enchanted&quot; object it destroys.
                                    If the clock&#39;s power is to decide whether she resurrects, then by
                                    destroying it, he eliminates that power. Since there&#39;s no longer a force
                                    enabling her to resurrect, she remains dead. This is another way to
                                    look at it, but again, only if the clock itself has that power over her
                                    life.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    If not, then the destruction of the clock becomes more a violent gesture
                                    of punctuation to accompany this &quot;divine ruling&quot;, like nails being
                                    driven into a coffin. Or, like a tolling bell. It&#39;s jarring, sudden, and
                                    carries finality.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    If you are convinced her actions are what decided her death, and not the
                                    destruction of the clock, then you are left to consider what outcome is
                                    most suitable, without having an absolute ruling on it. The clock did
                                    appear to lean &quot;just&quot; an instant before, and there are plenty of ways to
                                    argue in favor of a just death. There are many mitigating factors as
                                    well to supply a counter argument. It would not be that interesting if
                                    it were absolutely unambiguous, where everyone could all easily agree
                                    that her death was just. Or if everyone agreed there was no justice in
                                    it at all. There are enough factors in play where you have reason to
                                    think about it a bit, and such that it leaves plenty to discuss. You may
                                    consider the evidence and draw a conclusion. You may even feel very
                                    strongly about your conclusion! But for either the story, or me, to
                                    provide a categorically &quot;right answer&quot;, immediately following the
                                    establishment of all the things that made it interesting to consider,
                                    shortchanges all that, I believe. For the clock to settle
                                    unceremoniously on &quot;just&quot; I feel would come across as a nonconstructive,
                                    compact ethical lecture, quickly nullifying all there was to evaluate
                                    and talk about.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Was this comeuppance for all her past killing? For killing friends like
                                    Aradia and Tavros? Was there mitigation in her upbringing? In her
                                    remorse, and desire to change? Was it justice for insisting on playing a
                                    role in the creation of Jack so that she could beat him, to serve her
                                    ego? What of the ignored warning from Terezi? Flying off in spite of it,
                                    endangering them all, again in service of ego? What of the doomed
                                    timeline she creates by doing this? Is there justice alone in killing
                                    her to prevent not only the death of all her friends, but an offshoot
                                    reality that can only fail? Is human morality in play here? Troll
                                    morality?? Or is it a higher agency, like that permeating Skaia? In a
                                    framework of Skaian morality, is there justice in sacrificing one life
                                    to help ensure the creation of an entire universe? This paragraph has
                                    been a thumbnail sketch of all the discussion which has already taken
                                    place across the internet, minus all the notes ranging from fan fervor
                                    to outright dementia. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Of all the arguments to make, it&#39;s difficult to come up with a solid
                                    rationale for a heroic result. Most people debating it would choose
                                    between &quot;just&quot; or &quot;not just&quot;, i.e. die or live. Note that this means
                                    those who believe her death was not just are in fact arguing that the
                                    destruction of the clock is actually what killed her!!! There is nothing
                                    in the story which rules this out.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Regardless, the result is the same. She&#39;s dead. Out of the story for
                                    good? Who knows. For now it&#39;s the culmination of a wide arc importing
                                    elements from classic tragedy. Blind seers, wanton hubris, unheeded
                                    warnings, regret and death. But with some MSPA twists. Systematized
                                    mortality conditions, doomed timeline offshoots, way too much dramatic
                                    irony, and Nic Cage.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    She was always a polarizing character. Shouldn&#39;t be too surprising she&#39;s
                                    more polarizing than ever in death. It&#39;s almost as if that polarity was
                                    given concrete expression through the rules dictating whether she lived
                                    or died.<br>

                                    Since 4/13, I never imagined there would be a very significant
                                    6/12 &quot;celebratory update&quot;. It would require planning the right moment in
                                    the story for it to coincide exactly with that date, while allotting
                                    well beforehand the time to implement it when it comes, with no
                                    unforeseen delays at all. So I ruled it out well in advance to avoid the
                                    inevitable unpleasant conflict. The anticipation of such an update was a
                                    product of your inflated sense of expectation, and standards which you
                                    reserve for no comic artist other than me.<br>

                                    This will realistically never come up again, so here is how they work.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Matchsticks (11) travels through time using fire at any point in time as
                                    a gateway. He then likes to put out the fire when he arrives, so that
                                    more copies of him from other points in time don&#39;t show up and make
                                    things complicated. Unless he wants to exploit that for battle purposes,
                                    which he clearly didn&#39;t. Scratch keeps a fire alarm in his apartment to
                                    summon him, in case it catches fire, which it clearly did.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Quarters (14) has a collection of coins like the one Clover flipped.
                                    Each has numbers on either side, corresponding to a member of the Felt,
                                    most separated by 10, with a few exceptions. i.e.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    1, 11<br>
                                    2, 12<br>
                                    3, 13<br>
                                    4, 14<br>
                                    5, 15<br>
                                    6, 9<br>
                                    7, 10<br>
                                    8, 8<br>
                                    <br>
                                    When you flip the coin, it summons the member whose number is face up,
                                    from some place in space and time. If the opposite member is present
                                    during the flip, he trades places with that member, which is why Clover
                                    swapped for Quarters when he flipped 14.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    If you flip your own coin, and the result is your own number, you die.
                                    As such, Quarters entrusts his own coin with Clover, who is so lucky, he
                                    will never flip a 4. He uses it to summon Quarters when things get too
                                    hot to handle. It&#39;s not advisable to let Snowman flip her own coin.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The coins link pairs of Felt members. Some are relevant pairings, others
                                    don&#39;t make much sense. Die and Stitch have a similar power, with their
                                    destructive/healing voodoo doll and effigies. Doze and Eggs make a pair
                                    of morons with a funny duo name (dozen eggs!) Itchy runs around so fast
                                    he probably starts fires sometimes, while Matchsticks puts them out.

                                    Guys it is the FORMSPRING QUESTION OF THE DAY! Maybe I will only
                                    answer these vapid questions for a while, leaving you all to wonder how
                                    many penises trolls have. *<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I&#39;m a virgo, which is why when I was dressed as a troll in the story, I
                                    had a virgo shirt on. As a cool bonus, that symbol looks a little like
                                    it says &quot;Me&quot;, which is really quite ironic, since I myself happen to be
                                    me.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Two answer the second part of the question, yes it is very
                                    representative of who I am, because as I have mentioned before, I am a
                                    just this HUGE lesbian. Big time.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I was wearing a Karkat shirt today though, because I&#39;ve got all these HS
                                    shirts lying around that I wear sometimes. A cashier saw it and said,
                                    &quot;Hey I&#39;m a cancer too!&quot; And I didn&#39;t know what to say, so I said, &quot;Oh!
                                    ........................................... Haha! Yeah.&quot; And completed
                                    the transaction.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I&#39;m starting to be a little more reluctant to wear the HS shirts though,
                                    because they&#39;re starting to get me recognized in public more
                                    frequently. Not just as an HS reader, but as actually me, which will
                                    never not be a vaguely disorienting, Truman Showesque experience.<br>

                                    What took place over those pages is almost a direct transcription of
                                    what would have happened in the flash. The events were conveyed visually
                                    and verbally to suit the Scratch narration, instead of shown through
                                    high-intensity animated visuals alone. The Scratch segment was not
                                    introduced as a substitute for the animation. An &quot;abridged&quot; stretch like
                                    this was going to come anyway as a device for setting a few things up
                                    before starting on the EOA animation. Axing the Rose v. Jack / Vriska v.
                                    Jack animation (aka Heroes of Light: Strife) just meant moving Scratch
                                    the segment up sooner, to use as a vehicle for delivering the full flash
                                    concept without having to scrap it as a story direction, which would
                                    have been a pretty significant architectural upheaval. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Now that it&#39;s out there, we can examine the pros and cons of delivering
                                    it that way as opposed to flash. (But note, no matter what, there was no
                                    chance of that flash getting made whatsoever. This is really not about
                                    &quot;what could have been&quot;)<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Pros of flash:<br>
                                    <br>
                                    - Would have been WAY MORE RADICAL (frankly I don&#39;t care much about
                                    this. the rad quotient of preceding flash material is already pretty
                                    high, and there&#39;s plenty more combustible shit to come)<br>
                                    <br>
                                    - The idea as a whole would have been delivered in minutes, rather than
                                    weeks, giving people the full sense of the story development all at
                                    once, and limiting the drag on the serial readers&#39; experience, and
                                    corresponding vocalization of those frustrations (would have been BY FAR
                                    the biggest advantage of flash)<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Cons:<br>
                                    <br>
                                    - Concept as a whole may have been a bit challenging to parse with
                                    visuals alone. The two parallel battles are easy enough to understand,
                                    but I can easily imagine confusion over the alternate timeline concept
                                    as conveyed only visually. People have been confused by less. Much, much
                                    less.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    - Difficulty factor. Even with art contributors. There&#39;s a limit to not
                                    only what I can do personally, but what a largely unstructured volunteer
                                    effort can accomplish as well. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    - Hiatus-induced suicide pact among readership.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Pros of narration:<br>
                                    <br>
                                    - Get to experiment with a little parallel storytelling, via the top banner. (pretty
                                    big plus, IMO!)<br>
                                    <br>
                                    - Having it narrated removes ambiguity about a fairly cerebral chain of
                                    events, while allowing the chance to indirectly develop Scratch&#39;s
                                    involvement in the story a bit.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    - I get to take my time with it and pretend to function like a normal human being
                                    for a little while.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Cons: <br>
                                    <br>
                                    - Slow rolling the segment page by page has serial readers agonizing
                                    every step of the way over every conceivable issue, on points of
                                    execution, unwelcome &quot;story developments&quot;, and so on. Once again,
                                    Homestuck is RUINED FOREVER! Until it isn&#39;t, of course.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    - If you&#39;re not into Scratch as a character or don&#39;t like his tone or
                                    the whole omniscient smartass thing, then you probably aren&#39;t digging
                                    the arc much. Not much to say about this. It&#39;s just a &quot;you like it or
                                    you don&#39;t&quot; kind of thing.<br>

                                    - Altering the flow of the story always carries the risk of agitating
                                    some readers. Not only because mixing shit up = automatic complaints
                                    (which is definitely true), but because by accelerating the pace to make
                                    broader narrative strokes, you are inviting the usual objections
                                    fixated on showing vs. telling. But I think there are some legitimate
                                    gears of storytelling which involve showing by way of telling outright,
                                    as long as the reader has the patience to see it through to its
                                    conclusion (problematic serially, as usual). It&#39;s a gear in which bigger
                                    story chunks that normally are given strong magnification (like a
                                    death) are told more compactly and in succession. These bigger chunks,
                                    when stacked up, &quot;show&quot;, or more appropriately &quot;reveal&quot; an even bigger
                                    idea which is at the true heart of that narrative stretch. It&#39;s not the
                                    event which the reader momentarily feels &quot;should&quot; expand to fill the
                                    stage, like a death. The death that with hindsight functions as a
                                    building block of a more complete idea which more effectively serves the
                                    story as a whole, completing unfinished arcs, building on the themes
                                    and such.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    You can look at story pacing like rolling a Katamari ball, with respect
                                    to the granularity of what has focus. At the beginning of HS, I&#39;m
                                    rolling it around and picking up nickels and buttons. That&#39;s when John
                                    messing around with cakes and such has focus as actual plot points. The
                                    ball keeps rolling until points like that are too marginal to zoom in
                                    on, and he&#39;s exploring a mysterious oily land killing monsters and stuff
                                    while we gloss over a lot of detail that in an earlier mode would have
                                    received intense scrutiny. We are picking up things like traffic cones
                                    and bicycles with our katamari ball, while still sculpting a shape that
                                    as a whole resembles a story. Hivebent was rolled with even bigger
                                    denominations, maybe cars and trucks, gobbling up even bigger chunks
                                    like buildings by the end of the arc, as Aradia was offhandedly
                                    mentioning how they killed the king and created a universe. With
                                    hindsight we see why, understanding the overall purpose that arc had for
                                    the story, and how that particular pacing supported that purpose.
                                    Unlike Katamari though, the ball does get smaller sometimes, to go back
                                    to accommodating certain levels of detail like conversations and game
                                    mechanics, but it never dials all the way back. Doc has rolled with some
                                    of the biggest chunks yet, like buildings or mountains, casually
                                    dropping the deaths of characters as atomic features of his narration.
                                    He clearly rolls the ball smaller at times too, when he wants. But this
                                    construction too has purpose, which needs some patience to watch it take
                                    shape and then hindsight to fully appreciate.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    And like I&#39;ve suggested before, these can be pretty disastrous
                                    conditions for the serial intake of a story. But honestly, there is no
                                    other way to do it. To strive to satisfy serial readers all the time is
                                    to do nothing but make something terrible in the long run. It means you
                                    can&#39;t do much to set up anything sophisticated with deferred payoff, as
                                    you perpetually submit what will immediately gratify. I can&#39;t tell
                                    people that reading serially is the &quot;wrong&quot; way to read it, because this
                                    is not true. But there&#39;s no escaping the fact that having pages leaked
                                    out so slowly radically warps your perception of what is happening,
                                    sometimes for the better (community discussion, noticing details etc),
                                    but often aggravates (arc fatigue, rushing to judgment...) Try to
                                    imagine watching your favorite movie, for the first time ever, but only a
                                    minute at a time, every day. Sound frustrating? How often do you think
                                    you might get irritated with the director for his pacing decisions? Or
                                    his &quot;plot twists&quot;, which are really just the products of scenes cut
                                    short before fully paying off? How often do you think you might want to
                                    insist he move it along? What about reading your favorite book, but only
                                    receiving about a paragraph or two every day? And what if the
                                    author/director was tuned into the responses to this daily output? Is
                                    there anything he could do to outrun the impatience of the reader for
                                    plot points he&#39;s carefully set up to be evaluated in the minute-space of
                                    archival read-through, which the reader labors over in the month-space
                                    of serial digestion? Can he do anything to deflect or mitigate their
                                    rush to judgment of incomplete arcs? Should he? Probably not. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The pages spanning the two links above provide a pretty good example of
                                    how serial intake messes with perception, and of why authors tend to
                                    like to finish books before showing them to you. Now that it&#39;s all
                                    there, let&#39;s look at the reasonable serial reactions to some key
                                    moments, and compare to the reality in hindsight.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    - Terezi flips coin, Vriska flies away.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Serial reaction: augh, anticlimax!!! All that build up, the stair
                                    climbing and show downing and coin flipping... where&#39;s the battle?
                                    Where&#39;s........ SOMETHING?<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Reality: This was only the beginning of a deferred resolution to the
                                    ongoing Terezi/Vriska rivalry. The resolution was actually the full
                                    sweep of this series of events in totality, resulting in Terezi looking
                                    into the doomed timeline to find the rationale and the courage to kill
                                    Vriska, which she finally did. All that buildup was not for that
                                    one-page deflation, but this full sequence. Reservation of judgment was
                                    required, something that is much easier to practice when there are more
                                    pages to click on.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    .....<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I could go on but I just realized I&#39;m tired of typing. But really, the
                                    list goes on and on like this throughout the whole story. Things which
                                    come off as odd or vaguely unsatisfying or even JUST SO TERRIBLE in the
                                    short term, but make sense and work better overall in the big picture.<br>

                                    You could complete this exercise yourself if you felt like it. Look at
                                    an event, remember how you felt on reading it live, and now how you view
                                    it in retrospect. Or, for extra credit, imagine you could wipe your
                                    memory of the past several months of content, and pretend I just posted
                                    it all today. What would your reaction be? How does it read? Do the
                                    issues which seemed to loom so large in the moment, like the omnipresent
                                    &quot;get on with it&quot; factor, even cross your mind for a second during such
                                    an archival dump? And for extra extra credit, imagine wiping your memory
                                    of all of Homestuck, and I just dropped it all in your lap right now
                                    while you were idling musing what sort of thing I might work on after
                                    Problem Sleuth. What do you think? Of it in totality, and of recent
                                    events? What is there that wears thin, on its own terms of pacing,
                                    rather than that dictated by two years of attrition on one&#39;s ability to
                                    remain completely engaged and cognizant of all relevant threads?<br>
                                    <br>
                                    There is a lot to think about when you make a story. Not just in how to
                                    make it, but in how it is absorbed. One story is really two completely
                                    different stories. The one that is read all at once, and the one that is
                                    read over your shoulder while you make it.

                                    <br>
                                    Word about this was kindly spread by Lexxy, here: <a class="nofollow" href="http://lexxercise.tumblr.com/post/5923809387/no-selling-mspa-stuff-without-andrews-permission" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://lexxercise.tumblr.com/post/5923809387/no-selling-mspa-stuff-without-andrews-permission</a><br>

                                    Here is a thing to understand first. If you accept a commission to draw a
                                    Homestuck character without my permission, does that mean I will file a
                                    cease and desist order? Or if you sell an HS sketch at a convention,
                                    will I hunt you down, kick over your table, and then muss up your hair
                                    and stomp on your glasses?<br>
                                    <br>
                                    No, that would be silly.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I just clarified what the official position is, which is that you
                                    shouldn&#39;t attempt to profit from my work, or anyone else&#39;s for that
                                    matter, unless you have permission. It&#39;s not that I&#39;m suddenly outraged
                                    people are doing HS commissions and stuff. I&#39;ve previously taken an
                                    ultra passive attitude to all this. But the result of that, as well as
                                    the result in HS&#39;s growing popularity, has been a surging culture of
                                    casual copyright violation, which though seemingly harmless case by
                                    case, in totality is starting to look problematic. In particular, it
                                    seems to be leading to increasingly flagrant violations here and there,
                                    things which are more serious than a simple commission, and which I
                                    would be inclined to take measures to stop. It&#39;s easy to see how this
                                    trend develops. Someone notices wave after wave of HS artwork being sold
                                    by others, and presumes it&#39;s ok to take it a little further. And then
                                    further...<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I think it&#39;s better to address this before it turns into a bigger
                                    problem. Honestly, the theoretical money I am losing is not what is
                                    motivating me here. When you do an HS commission, I can&#39;t really imagine
                                    how that translates to dollars leaving my pocket, other than projecting
                                    losses in the very big picture if stuff like that goes unchecked. It&#39;s
                                    mainly a little unsettling to watch so many people at once act so
                                    casually about profiting off another&#39;s IP without asking, and even more
                                    unsettling to imagine it spiraling out of control. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    It may be the case that a sketch of a Pokemon sold to your friend is an
                                    unenforceable violation, and Nintendo will never get involved, but it is
                                    still technically a violation. Please understand the fact that it is
                                    unenforceable does not make it less of a violation. You have profited
                                    from Nintendo&#39;s property, without permission. Which is not to say there
                                    are not degrees of violation beyond this which are more flagrant, but we
                                    should be clear about it. Knowing that, you might decide to do it
                                    anyway. Or you might decide to ask Nintendo permission. (They would say
                                    no. I might not, though.)<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Requiring you to ask permission isn&#39;t much of an imposition. But I
                                    hesitate to guarantee satisfaction even if you do, because for one
                                    thing, your email might slip through the cracks and I might not get back
                                    to you. It&#39;s happened before. I&#39;ve had requests like this, and some
                                    I&#39;ve responded to favorably, while others I didn&#39;t get around to
                                    replying to. Which I feel bad about, as I generally feel bad I can&#39;t
                                    answer all my mail, but that&#39;s how it goes. All I can say is, if you&#39;re
                                    wondering, ask. I may say yes. I may say no. I may not respond. If I
                                    don&#39;t, then you may use your discretion, while understanding the
                                    position I have taken. If you cross a line, there&#39;s a good chance you&#39;ll
                                    hear from me eventually. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I&#39;d rather this not be about finding out exactly what I do or don&#39;t
                                    allow, and then just getting down to furiously attacking that wiggle
                                    room I give. I&#39;d rather it be about respect for the property of artists.
                                    Everyone who this affects is an artist as well, presumably. If you&#39;re
                                    an artist, you should care about this topic and evaluate your standards,
                                    because you are undoubtedly hoping others will respect your work and
                                    your rights as well. Imagine you are at a convention, selling Pokemon
                                    drawings or such. If you knew one of Nintendo&#39;s most aggressive lawyers
                                    was lurking nearby, would you still do it? Is it fear of being
                                    prosecuted that motivates you to stop? Or is it the fact that you do not
                                    own Pokemon, and though it belongs to a multi billion dollar company
                                    that won&#39;t feel the slightest hardship because of you, it doesn&#39;t seem
                                    right, because these aren&#39;t your creations? Or maybe it is less about
                                    respect to the original creator, and more about taking pride in selling
                                    what you have created yourself, or at the very least, that which you
                                    have been given the right to?<br>
                                    <br>
                                    And if the idea of selling black market Pokemon stuff makes you feel
                                    uncomfortable, where the owner has millions of dollars applied to a
                                    legal staff interested in crushing IP violations no matter how well
                                    intended, then why would you feel better about selling stuff owned by a
                                    guy without a tiny fraction of those resources, who has heretofore shown
                                    not even the slightest interest in taking action against his
                                    enthusiastic fans? <br>
                                    <br>
                                    These are things for you to think about, and then act according to your
                                    internal compass on the matter. I am not going to TAKE YOU DOWN if you
                                    sell a sketch of a troll to a friend or whatever. I&#39;m just letting you
                                    know my position, and will be reasonably content to let the fans govern
                                    themselves, unless certain lines are crossed. Then we will talk.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    As for the Formspring Question of the Day...<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Eventually, before I die, I would like to somehow, some way, get my hands on that
                                    god damn fucking tiger.

                                    I am of the opinion that the garments are ideal as they are.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    A truly authentic god hood, with a long, darker blue hood, and short
                                    sleeves, would be a costume. It would not be a garment most people would
                                    actually be interested in wearing on a day to day basis. Some would,
                                    absolutely. The majority of interested buyers? Nope, especially
                                    considering what it would cost.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    To manufacture such an item in a significant volume would be so complex,
                                    it would take a very long time, and would cost a fortune. It&#39;s hard to
                                    express how absurd this undertaking would be from my standpoint, and the
                                    standpoint of good business practice.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I am sorry the reality does not match your expectations. They would be
                                    reasonable expectations if Homestuck was a property of, say, Disney. And
                                    the top Disney honcho could make a call to the guy in the Chinese
                                    factory which Disney undoubtedly owns and say &quot;Hey, let&#39;s make a million
                                    of these.&quot; and have that operational agility, and ability to make it
                                    cost effective through outrageous volume. Unfortunately, Disney doesn&#39;t
                                    own Homestuck yet.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    So what you see is the best possible shirt in the real world, but also
                                    by any standard I think. It is pretty close to the shirt in the comic,
                                    while still being a very normal, wearable garment that doesn&#39;t make
                                    people feel like they are trucking down to the local anime convention
                                    whenever they leave the house in it.

                                    I don&#39;t know. If I&#39;d unearthed that info while messing with it I might have run with

                                    <br>
                                    But really all that stuff wasn&#39;t just about how dumb I thought CS5 was.
                                    Long story short, I spent way too long trying to get CS3 to work, tried
                                    out CS5 for a bit, bailed on it, then fixed CS3. Now it&#39;s pretty much
                                    ok.

                                    I don&#39;t. Bear in mind, the time required was only part of the equation. There&#39;s also
                                    the effort.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The planned animation would have been a major escalation in production
                                    value. The sophistication of the animations has increased over time, and
                                    part of the point of this for me is to keep pushing the envelope, but
                                    there are limits to how far you can go. It&#39;s good to keep pushing and
                                    find your limits and test them, but realistically you&#39;ll have to pull
                                    back at some point. Because that is what a limit is. A line between
                                    something you can do, and something that is literally impossible.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I&#39;m not saying the animation I had in mind was impossible, but it was
                                    approaching scary territory. I just made a judgment and decided it
                                    wasn&#39;t worth the energy, all things considered.

                                    Seriously, don&#39;t read this. It&#39;s so boring.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    A couple weeks ago my computer broke so rather than go through the
                                    rigmarole of getting it back up and running I just bought another cheap
                                    computer and copied all my shit over to it to solve the problem as
                                    quickly and painlessly as possible so I could just keep working. That
                                    went ok.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    This as I said tends to be what I do when I run into technical problems
                                    rather than bang my head against the wall for days with diagnostics and
                                    part-swappings and repairs, and so I can just keep working and doing
                                    stuff that&#39;s actually important instead of dicking around with
                                    electronics.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Maybe it sounds wasteful but it isn&#39;t. I just use the old machine as a
                                    spare computer, after fixing it up GRADUALLY, at a leisurely pace, where
                                    doing so will not present an obstacle to continuous work. So that&#39;s
                                    what I did. But in this case, I liked my old machine better than the new
                                    one, so once it was fixed up and ready to go, I prepared to make a
                                    quick hop back over to old machine and keep the new one as a spare. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Except the hop wasn&#39;t quick, for one reason. Photoshop and Flash didn&#39;t
                                    work after installation. (the whole CS3 suite, actually) Still not sure
                                    why. At this point I&#39;m guessing the installation file got corrupted
                                    somehow in all the shuffle. Of course the road to understanding you&#39;re
                                    dealing with a very serious problem is paved with all these excruciating
                                    diagnostic measures, like uninstalling/reinstalling CS3 a dozen times
                                    and even reinstalling Windows a few times in 32 and 64 bit mode to make
                                    sure something like that isn&#39;t fucking up the works. Particularly
                                    maddening since I JUST INSTALLED it on my new machine a couple weeks ago
                                    and it worked fine. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    And this kind of shit is exactly why I don&#39;t fight with computers
                                    anymore, I just replace them. Except that policy is really difficult to
                                    put into play in a situation like this, where the software is at issue
                                    regardless of what machine you use. But actually, I did investigate this
                                    approach anyway. It&#39;s just a more bitter pill to swallow because Adobe
                                    CS5 (their latest, solely offered version) costs literally five times
                                    what my computer cost. So I thought, maybe that&#39;s ok, maybe this is a
                                    good time to upgrade even if it&#39;s ridiculously expensive. So a good
                                    chunk of time I spent looking into CS5, downloading the trial and all.
                                    Photoshop CS5 is a very nice program, pretty elegantly designed, but I
                                    discovered it has one hideous flaw that makes it practically unusable to
                                    me. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    If you use Photoshop, maybe you know about it. I&#39;m getting the sense it bugs a lot
                                    of people. It&#39;s summarized here.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    <a class="nofollow" href="http://forums.cgsociety.org/archive/index.php/t-899953.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://forums.cgsociety.org/archive/index.php/t-899953.html</a><br>
                                    <br>
                                    When I use Photoshop, generally I have 5 or 10 or even 20 documents open
                                    at all times. Actually, they&#39;re always open, even when I&#39;m not using
                                    PS. This is how I work on Homestuck, I just have a ton of pertinent
                                    files open all the time so I don&#39;t have to spend as much time rooting
                                    around for stuff. Having all those files clog up the taskbar is moronic.
                                    The &quot;tabbed documents&quot; system is just as moronic, for my process.
                                    Tabbed web browsing is a brilliant innovation. Tabbed PS document
                                    navigation, not so much, since many PS users like to be able to look at
                                    more than one document at once, side by side. Not sure why the
                                    developers thought they struck gold with this feature. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I wouldn&#39;t give a shit about any of this if they just made these
                                    features optional, and allowed CS3-like behavior to exist. And I might
                                    even make an attempt to get used to it, if Adobe wasn&#39;t asking for
                                    nearly $2000 for the suite (or $1700, for just Photoshop + Flash CS5).
                                    I&#39;m not going to pay that kind of money on something that just makes me
                                    angry to use. Adobe seems to think I&#39;ll be delighted to whip out my
                                    credit card for the privilege of a mandatory workflow overhaul. Think
                                    again bros.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Eventually I just gave up on the CS5 idea, and after undergoing a whole
                                    lot more terribleness too boring to mention, I finally just got CS3
                                    working again instead. So that&#39;s that dumb story.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    This was all pretty aggravating and exhausting, and kinda made me lose
                                    my train of thought on the story. Piling this on top of other recent
                                    disruptions like traveling and the preceding technical bullshit doesn&#39;t
                                    help much. Constant forward motion on the story tends to be what keeps
                                    the thing living in my head, and I&#39;m finding if you stack up enough
                                    major interruptions, it isn&#39;t just lost labor time that accounts for
                                    delay, but disrupted inspiration, as I have to completely regroup on
                                    what the fuck I was even thinking before shit hit the fan. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    And it doesn&#39;t really help that it&#39;s a fairly delicate part of the story
                                    where the point is to wrap up a lot complex stuff in some kind of
                                    sensible way, rather than the typical mode of casual meandering, where
                                    we could hop over to some funny conversation that isn&#39;t particularly
                                    important otherwise and I could just say, There, there is your content,
                                    enjoy. It&#39;s really the perfect storm of built up story complexity,
                                    commitment to a methodical resolution of everything, radically
                                    rethinking long-planned points of execution (i.e. axing huge flash
                                    plans, figuring out how to structure/convey them statically), and a
                                    disastrous series of technical disruptions. Updates just can&#39;t push
                                    through this any faster than they are right now.

                                    continue in that style, adding new animation frames, characters, etc.
                                    All very loosely, without a lot of parameters beyond that. Eyes5 did the
                                    Jack, myluckyseven did a Rose frame. There should be more to come.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    This was originally going to be a Flash project, but I cancelled it.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Everything happening now, and over the next bunch of pages, would have
                                    taken place in a pretty energetic, and much more sophisticated than
                                    usual strife animation. Kind of like &quot;strife version 2&quot;, for the second
                                    disc. I planned this idea months ago, not really thinking much of the
                                    effort and time it would eventually require to complete. This is what I
                                    usually do, blithely make such ambitious plans, pay the price later, but
                                    fight through it with a major grind and honor the original vision.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    This was a little different though. Not only was this meant to be a much
                                    more elaborate type of animation by my own stakes-raising declaration,
                                    with more frames-intensive visuals like a typical 2D fighter, but on top
                                    of that, the rate of output had been slowing, and the story flow was
                                    already kind of logjamming. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    So I had to make a decision. I could either apply what I now estimate
                                    would have been two or three solid weeks of serious effort to make this
                                    one pretty cool animation, and watch several 100K people sink into a
                                    state of despair over the prolonged suspension in content only to have
                                    the story advance not particularly far through a totally radical battle
                                    scene, or I could scrap the whole plan and figure something else out.
                                    The latter is what you&#39;re seeing.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Sometimes these adjustments have to be made. I&#39;ve revised plans before,
                                    and had some cool ideas I&#39;ve scrapped. I was going to include another
                                    round in the Dave vs. Bro battle where they used their Sylladexes to
                                    wage a hashrap battle (which is why I went to the trouble of making Dave
                                    collect all that dangerous shit in his kitchen before climbing to the
                                    roof). But I axed that because the battle was already taking too much
                                    time to produce and bottlenecking plot advancement. That idea was pretty
                                    easily phased out. This is different now, because revising these plans
                                    meant I had to change the way a large chunk of the story would be
                                    delivered, because a lot of story components were all tangled up in my
                                    plans for that animation. So I had to do a lot of rethinking, and much
                                    of the solution is what you&#39;re seeing now, which is having the scratched
                                    disc interfere with the flow of the story, and Scratch taking over
                                    narration duties at an accelerated pace while he fixes the disc in time
                                    for the end of act. This is in part my way of committing not to doing
                                    anymore flash stuff until the EOA, which itself is going to be a very
                                    laborious thing and will take a long time to finish.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    This is all fine. I don&#39;t mind turning my plans upside down sometimes,
                                    since it can lead to creative opportunities for handling this stuff. The
                                    disc errors, Scratch hijacking the site design while narrating, all
                                    this strikes me as in keeping with the spirit of the story and the
                                    flexible format. Keeping the story moving is important, but it&#39;s not the
                                    sole consideration. MSPA for me is about working with loads of fun
                                    ideas, both for the story itself and the way it&#39;s told. Very often that
                                    consideration is at odds with pacing. I do what I can to balance both.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The biggest challenge in this respect by far has been Flash. I&#39;m quite
                                    ambivalent on its role in Homestuck. On one hand, it completely changes
                                    the way the story is read and perceived, for the better I think. It
                                    brings a lot of the most important parts of the story to life, makes for
                                    significant dramatic impact when needed, and goes a long way in making
                                    this difficult to classify as a medium. One the other hand, it magnifies
                                    the production complexity exponentially, and I&#39;m not just talking about
                                    the effort the animations require. It affects everything about my
                                    approach to the story. Including the whole decision making process, and
                                    not in a particularly good way, at least not from my perspective.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The biggest way it affects the process is how it stretches the story
                                    out. If I&#39;d gone through with the axed strife animation, that would be
                                    an obvious example, pausing the story a couple weeks to make some people
                                    fight. But the delaying effects can be more subtle than that. I&#39;ll have
                                    in mind a certain event in the story which I think should be handled
                                    through Flash. I&#39;ll know it&#39;s coming up, but I might not be ready to
                                    launch into that kind of work for whatever reason. Maybe it&#39;s too soon
                                    on the heels of the last one or whatever. So I&#39;ll work on more static
                                    panels, because there is never a shortage of plot threads to address or
                                    details to develop or funny conversations to write or new fun ideas to
                                    put out there. And that&#39;s fine really, since I feel like it&#39;s all good
                                    stuff, but it definitely makes for the long road. I&#39;m quite sure
                                    Homestuck would be finished by now if I&#39;d never used flash at all.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    There are other weird ways it factors in, like certain expectations it
                                    creates. Once it gets in the readers&#39; heads that it&#39;s a recurring device
                                    for the story, they start to look out for it and expect it in certain
                                    situations, compare static content with flash, consider how awesome some
                                    static panels would have been if done in flash or how awesome situation
                                    X will be if animated with song Y. The potential for disappointment
                                    looms constantly with increased expectations. None of this is
                                    particularly bad, but if you&#39;re the guy responsible for putting together
                                    this story, you tend to be keenly aware of it, and it factors into the
                                    big puzzle of managing it all. And a big part of that puzzle has been
                                    answering the question &quot;to flash or not to flash?&quot; <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I&#39;ve said before, the deeper into this I get, the less I feel like a
                                    writer or artist, and more I&#39;m like a producer, managing story decisions
                                    weighed carefully against cost of execution. And cost can mean a lot of
                                    things. Effort needed, organizational complexity (usually most present
                                    in interactive pages), time delay or obstruction to story advancement,
                                    stuff like that. This kind of thing doesn&#39;t factor in if you&#39;re writing
                                    something more conventional, like a book. You write in exactly what
                                    serves the story, as you envision it. It may sound crazy that&#39;s not what
                                    I&#39;m doing, but it really can&#39;t be anymore, not with these high octane
                                    animations in the mix as part of the expected delivery. I have to think
                                    like a producer to make that work. To understand what that means, here&#39;s
                                    an anecdote about Indiana Jones, which might not be quite true but
                                    whatever, it&#39;s just something I&#39;m vaguely remembering. When Spielberg
                                    was going over the script with somebody, it called for a pit full of
                                    lions, and he said &quot;whoa! too expensive! let&#39;s go with snakes.&quot; So you
                                    got Indy afraid of snakes instead of lions, because it turns out you can
                                    buy crazy loads of snakes for bargain bux. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    It would be really reasonable for him to be afraid of lions though. They
                                    are huge and hungry and fucking terrifying. Have you SEEN a lion???
                                    Lions would be my quirky phobia if I was a rugged dude with a whip and
                                    longing for treasure.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    <br>

                                    I am not trapped in Canada. I got back on monday night. The
                                    grumpy customs guy looked at me suspiciously and considered the threat I
                                    posed to this nation for a little while, and then I guess finally
                                    decided to do me this rad solid by letting me back into my own country.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The Toronto Comic Arts festival was fun and I met lots of cool people. I
                                    lost track of how many buckets I was asked to sign I think after the
                                    fourth bucket or so. One time a guy asked me to fill his bucket with a
                                    clear fluid he supplied, so I did, and the undertaking was filmed,
                                    probably for distribution on the amateur pornography market. Some people
                                    kind of tried to sing to me once, and I rewarded their ring leader with
                                    a bottle of Faygo (a crate of which was given to me as a gift. I can at
                                    this point count on gifts of Faygo, Gushers, and candy corn at any
                                    convention with total certainty.) The fellow opened the Faygo with
                                    showman&#39;s aplomb, and the bottle snorted an angry, umbrella shaped jet
                                    of atrocious cola on to himself, his belongings, and all who surrounded
                                    him. I showed my contrition by looking suitably horrified. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The convention only occupied the weekend, but in truth its footprint
                                    spanned 5 solid days when you account for travel time on thursday and
                                    monday, horsing around in Toronto on friday, and may even span 7 days
                                    when you consider how useless a person can be on the days before and
                                    after traveling extensively. So that is an entire week existing as a
                                    black hole in my creative schedule on account of two pretty decent days
                                    in Canada. This is probably why I don&#39;t do a lot of cons.<br>

                                    On the subject of momentum killers, the preceding weekend my computer
                                    broke, so I bought a new one and spent time setting it up. I don&#39;t ever
                                    try to fix computers anymore. I just buy new ones, and copy my files
                                    over. I&#39;ve learned not to fight with computers over the years. Expending
                                    the energy to win these little skirmishes is not worth the years it
                                    shaves off the end of your life. It steals a lot of time just to
                                    diagnose problems, let alone agonize through solutions. Paying for
                                    service and new parts and such also takes time, not to mention money
                                    which could be applied toward a brand new computer which doesn&#39;t hate
                                    you yet. You should take my advice. The next time some device gives you
                                    problems, don&#39;t fight with it. Just acknowledge to the device, &quot;You win.
                                    You are broken. You will be replaced immediately.&quot; This is a liberating
                                    policy. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The thing is, a computer isn&#39;t even very expensive. You can get a pretty
                                    alright one for like $300 or $400. My disc drive failed. Yes, a
                                    scratched disc. We&#39;ll forgo mention of HS themes cropping up in my life
                                    cause I don&#39;t even know what to say about that. I&#39;ve had drives fail
                                    before, which basically happens for no reason. It&#39;s something they do.
                                    It&#39;s a good thing nothing important depends on hard drives being
                                    reliable. Except I guess practically all of modern civilization, but
                                    whatever. So I&#39;d have to buy a new hard drive for $100 or so, a fuckin
                                    copy of goddamn Windows (which I don&#39;t even have, I always just inherit
                                    OS&#39;s from new machines) for like $200, and jump through all these hoops,
                                    or just spend approximately the same amount of money on some dumb
                                    pre-assembled machine off a store rack that is hot and ready to go, and
                                    remain blissfully uninvolved with a piece of technology&#39;s staggering,
                                    intractable neurosis. I just copy my files over. When a drive dies, it
                                    never actually spoils your data much. It only ever seems to break just
                                    enough to make the OS go funky, and difficult/impossible to boot up. And
                                    the more you run it, the more it corrupts, which is why you stop
                                    immediately, forfeit all hope of salvaging it, and buy a new computer. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Even though that was about as painless a solution as possible, it was
                                    still a significant momentum drain, and last week was pretty slow
                                    content-wise. So&#39;s this one. Momentum drags are pretty common these
                                    days. That&#39;s just the shape of things, and it&#39;s all been fastidiously
                                    filed under Oh Well already, so don&#39;t worry.<br>

                                    TCAF amounted to about a week long black hole of output, through which
                                    not only did you get to not read anything, but I was not even remotely
                                    applying effort toward something you will read later. That effort begins
                                    only now, as I get my shit together, and puzzle over the plans I left
                                    dangling. These plans are usually kept rational and aloft in my mind
                                    through perpetual, feverish creative activity. They begin to resemble
                                    the overambitious boondoggles they truly are when I&#39;m forced to slow
                                    down. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    What I&#39;m presently puzzling over is why I decided to leave a Flash
                                    project for myself to return to. Not really the best idea. But it&#39;ll be
                                    done when it&#39;s done, even if the gap in the archive from 5/5 to 5/? will
                                    probably seem cavernous relative to the eventual payoff. <br>

                                    All I&#39;ve really been up to is not working on it 24/7. Not
                                    working on a thing 24/7 shouldn&#39;t really need an explanation. Like
                                    nobody goes up to you and asks you why you aren&#39;t working on a thing
                                    24/7, because that&#39;s a nutty thing to ask someone. Unless you have
                                    trained a very large population to expect this behavior from you over an
                                    uninterrupted period spanning three years. In which case my strong
                                    advice to such a person who has done that is: ???????????????<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The animation took 4 days or so, but really it wasn&#39;t especially long
                                    and something like that should have taken me about 2 days or maybe less
                                    if I were working in Hell Mode. But I had a lot of other important
                                    things to do which stretched out the time. For instance, watching some
                                    episodes of 30 Rock. I also ran some unsuccessful errands, like I went
                                    to the UPS Store to mail my stupid broken iPhone back to Apple, because
                                    it&#39;s dumb and broken and I kind of hate it. But the UPS Store&#39;s computer
                                    wasn&#39;t working or something, so I left. I went back again another day,
                                    but it was the same story. I muddled around with some tweens and and
                                    cajoled a billion little image files, saved in photoshop one by one and
                                    imported into Flash which is technology on par with a broken iphone in
                                    terms of raw aggravation factor. I went to Starbucks a bunch of times
                                    and bought some coffee, and at one point I netflixed Robocop on the PS3,
                                    and wound up fast forwarding through all the scenes where he was
                                    sitting around without his helmet on looking weird and talking about his
                                    robofeelings, because the movie wasn&#39;t really as good as I wanted to
                                    remember it being. I horsed around with some cats, by which I guess I
                                    mean coexisted with them which is mostly all you do with a pet
                                    ultimately. The younger one has taken to nursing on the slightly not as
                                    young one, which is weird because she is like her adopted older sister
                                    who is barely even much bigger than her. But the older one seems fine
                                    with it and actually starts purring, because pretty much every cat in
                                    the world is as least partially insane. At some point I realized I
                                    should stop shitting around and get down to fucking business. I dug deep
                                    down to tap into my inner reserves of determination and strength, and
                                    with all of my mettle brought to bear on the task I buckled down and was
                                    finally able to watch another 10 or 15 episodes of 30 Rock.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    And then I finished the animation.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    As for what I did today, i.e. the day after posting it, I don&#39;t know.
                                    Mostly sitting around thinking about how I want to execute some stuff
                                    coming up next, and revising some overly ambitious plans which were
                                    certainly made in the heat of labor-addled delirium. Also I did some
                                    other stuff. I made some pasta, and drove some cardboard boxes
                                    somewhere. <br>

                                    To be fair, if I were working at &quot;normal speed&quot;, updates over
                                    the last 5 days could easily have been compressed into one day. I kinda
                                    doubt anybody would be urging me to get on with it if that were the
                                    case.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Regardless, here is some additional perspective on the matter of the pressing need
                                    for plot advancement.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Do you recall that at one point, WV spent about three weeks fucking
                                    around with cans in a bunker before he finally blasted off? In Act 1, we
                                    watched John launch cakes out of his sylladex for two months before we
                                    even discovered the story had a plot.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    This is how this works. At times it advances through stretches of
                                    unremarkable events wherein characters are given space to fool around.
                                    The story then continues to build on the details that accumulate. That
                                    is how every story on this website has been created, and the practice
                                    has been adhered to religiously. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Sometimes, even in the heat of my most productive periods, these
                                    &quot;goofing around phases&quot; still represent a kind of decompression. When I
                                    am just not quite ready to ATTACK major plot advancement in the manner
                                    that it would require, and it&#39;s simpler and more sustainable to mess
                                    around, do silly things, and keep production relatively light weight.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I remember when WV was horsing around with Can Town, there were similar
                                    murmurs of impatience, and many believed firmly it couldn&#39;t possibly be
                                    going anywhere that served the story. Nobody could know his big can in
                                    the desert would blast off soon, let alone that a year later, for
                                    reasons they couldn&#39;t yet fathom, thousands of teenagers to smear gray
                                    makeup all over their faces because of stuff that happened in this
                                    story. What could possibly happen later that would cause this??? Pretty
                                    hard to imagine, when you&#39;re the guy in December of &#39;09, impatiently
                                    waiting for WV to eat parts of a pumpkin, drink Tab, and play chess with
                                    himself.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    To find out, you had to be in it for the long haul, as you must now be. I
                                    will do what I am going to do, and one way or another, it will get
                                    where it&#39;s headed. It always does.

                                    I didn&#39;t even name the Midnight Crew. The name was submitted
                                    through a donation command before Homestuck. I named and designed the
                                    members of the group to complete the request. It began here, and there
                                    are several others.<br>

                                    Like many things in donation commands (zillyhoo, doomsday dice
                                    cascader...) the MC was adapted into Homestuck through the elaborate
                                    plot devices you may recall, driven by the usual MSPA meta-humor which
                                    you have grown to [feel some way about], which at this very moment
                                    continues unabated. (Remember the MC was introduced in HS as the MSPA
                                    adventure the kids could read if they visited MSPA.com. Then it turned
                                    out that MSPA was, in a way, a viewport into the troll universe, where
                                    the MC was real, and consisted of Jack &amp; co. as exiles on Alternia.)<br>

                                    But I didn&#39;t know about the Morton song until Radiation adapted samples from it into
                                    Black, which accompanied [S] Jack: Ascend.<br>
                                    <br>

                                    <br>
                                    The song was recorded 100 years before HS began. There&#39;s not much info
                                    out there on the guy or the song. Would anyone be all that surprised if
                                    it was released on 4/13/1909?

                                    I don&#39;t know. I hardly ever read more than half way down the first page of
                                    questions. Too many, too repetitive, etc.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    But through various channels, I detect certain flavors of reaction,
                                    ranging from disappointment to frustration to something faintly
                                    resembling outrage, not just at the lack of an incendiary production to
                                    mark year 2, but also the flagging rate of output in recent weeks.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    These reactions are far from universal, but they exist, and to address
                                    them I think an education on why MSPA exists at all is in order. If you
                                    see a creator who begins to languish in production of what presumably
                                    accounts for his day job, the impression may be that he is falling down
                                    on the job and failing to live up to his professional commitment. So
                                    maybe this is the source of indignation, re: entitlement, that some may
                                    feel when my output falters. The problem is, MSPA is not a day job for
                                    me. It is an all consuming lifestyle. Hence, the mirage that is the
                                    apparent ease of output for what is at times ludicrous volumes of
                                    material is highly sensitive to even slight perturbations in my life
                                    situation. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Let me put it this way. You may work a full time job. It may be that
                                    something happens in your life that makes your job more difficult,
                                    because you are preoccupied. Your work may suffer to some extent, but
                                    you can still approximately match what&#39;s expected of you, because there
                                    is a partition between your job and your home life. You may nevertheless
                                    feel your full time job seems to dominate your existence, saps your
                                    energy, and leaves your weekend respites feeling all too short. This is
                                    not an experience I share, because MSPA is not a full time job. If you
                                    have such a job, then I would have to RADICALLY REDUCE my workload to
                                    match your level of day to day preoccupation.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The actual quantities involved have always been nebulous and I never
                                    made a point of keeping track, but 12 hours per day seems like a pretty
                                    reasonable average, since that is just shy of all waking hours. Time
                                    spent writing, drawing, animating, or just spacing out at my monitor
                                    while contemplating all the moving parts. This is what I did every day,
                                    including weekends and holidays, for two years, and to some extent
                                    another year prior to that with Problem Sleuth. Only a few weekends were
                                    missed due to conventions, and there was a single week off immediately
                                    following the infamous &quot;robo smooch&quot;, and that&#39;s it. (Most of that week
                                    was spent wondering why the hell I wasn&#39;t updating...) There are other
                                    gaps in the archive, spanning days or a week, when I was animating.
                                    Those spans involved the usual work schedule, while simply omitting
                                    sleep!<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Not only is this an unreasonable workload to expect of anyone, it&#39;s
                                    practically impossible to pull it off. Maybe you can expect some
                                    committed guy out there to really buckle down and duplicate that effort
                                    for a month or two. But years? Too much can crop up in the white noise
                                    of normal life to destabilize it. Momentum is absolutely crucial for
                                    maintaining that kind of pace. I find that if I only do an hour of work
                                    in a day, I get ten minutes of work done. If I do 12 hours of work, I
                                    seem to get 24 hours of work done. This is especially true of animation.
                                    Such projects notoriously take a very long time. I feel like because of
                                    the crazy head of steam I&#39;ve built up from years of nonstop effort, I
                                    can knock out in days something that might take another animator a week.
                                    Or in a week what might take a month. Without that momentum, it&#39;s not
                                    possible. Starting up Flash cold is excruciating. Getting your head back
                                    into the stride of a story wastes energy you wouldn&#39;t use if you never
                                    broke stride. Without the momentum, the pace reverts to ordinary.
                                    Getting distracted by life destroys the momentum. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I&#39;ve been pretty zealous about deflecting the distractions, even when I
                                    move, as I often do. A notable example was last year when I came back
                                    from the Emerald City con in Seattle, and found my apartment flooded.
                                    The con was already enough of a time sink, so I didn&#39;t have much of an
                                    appetite for going into personal crisis mode. I just kind of shrugged,
                                    picked my computer off the lone, miraculously dry part of the floor,
                                    dropped it in a temporary residence, and kept drawing. I think the flood
                                    mess occupied about a day of my attention, whereas something like that
                                    could easily take up weeks of your time and energy if you&#39;re living that
                                    &quot;normal life&quot;. You know how it is, you come home and find water up to
                                    your ankles and go aw fuck, what&#39;s ruined, what needs replacing, gotta
                                    call whoever and deal with the fuckin landlord about stuff and auuuugh. I
                                    just didn&#39;t bother with any of that, because it just didn&#39;t seem to
                                    matter, and I preferred to keep working and not give a crap about all my
                                    soggy bullshit. And in retrospect, I guess it really didn&#39;t matter. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    All of my moves have been similarly characterized by the unceremonious
                                    transportation of a computer and a few boxes to a new room, in which I&#39;d
                                    continue working as if no change took place, with no service paid to
                                    the life that would be lived there, except as a workspace. I moved again
                                    recently, prompted by decidedly less dramatic and less soggy reasons
                                    than after Emerald City. This time, for whatever reason, I did it
                                    differently. I moved the normal way, the way I imagine normal people
                                    doing when I close my eyes, whereby more than a car trunk full of
                                    utilitarian belongings are imported into the household, placed on the
                                    floor, and never unpacked until the next moving day. I am not
                                    necessarily PROHIBITIVELY busy, but like I said above, any dent in the
                                    momentum, whether its a few trips to Home Depot or Target here and there
                                    or somehow waking up to discover I&#39;d absconded from a shelter with two
                                    particularly energetic young cats, is something that precludes a pace of
                                    output that is insane and often bordering on miraculous.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    What I&#39;m trying to convey here is this isn&#39;t necessarily any sort of
                                    break, or a grand announcement of a big slowdown for MSPA. I&#39;m trying to
                                    give you a sense of the reality which made MSPA heretofore possible,
                                    and that if for a period of time I descend from an altitude far
                                    exceeding the hours of a full time job, into &quot;merely&quot; those of a full
                                    time job, IT DOESN&#39;T ACTUALLY COUNT AS A BREAK! And certainly not as any
                                    sort of violation in a pact with the readership. Different from what
                                    you&#39;re used to? Sure. But you should never find yourself in a position
                                    where you come to expect, let alone demand, that degree of effort from
                                    anyone, even me. If my output &quot;sputters&quot; from 10 pages a day to 1 or 2
                                    or 3, IDEALLY (re: unrealistically) this should not even cause you to
                                    voice an internal observation on the matter! And if one is voiced,
                                    instead of &quot;oops, looks like Andrew&#39;s slipping,&quot; it should be &quot;oops,
                                    looks like Andrew&#39;s being a regular dude for a while.&quot; <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Not that detecting a pace change is some terrible wrongdoing, since
                                    clearly I&#39;ve done everything in my power to establish these absurd
                                    precedents, and people have naturally associated this with The Brand.
                                    I&#39;d just like to suggest it would be beneficial to the reader to
                                    disentangle enjoyment of the content from the torrid pace its been
                                    commonly delivered. Who can say how fast or slow it&#39;ll come in year
                                    three? Would my assurances even be reliable? Maybe it&#39;ll stay at the
                                    current pace for a good long while. Maybe it&#39;ll soon hasten back to
                                    something more typical. Maybe it&#39;ll come back FASTER THAN EVER. Who
                                    cares??? Do you really NEED this site to be the fastest comic on the
                                    block to enjoy it? Are you prepared to contend with the backlash to your
                                    psyche that is risked by so fervently relishing that particular
                                    property of the comic? What if it&#39;s taken away? Don&#39;t go boasting to
                                    your neighbors that your slave can pick cotton ten times faster than
                                    theirs. It&#39;s unbecoming. Just enjoy the fluffy yield of his furious
                                    hands, while you wait and pray for Abe Lincoln to gently stroke his
                                    beard and relieve you of your bigotry.

                                    Primarily it is that Jeffrey Rowland of Topatoco and I think
                                    that making these terrible shirts is hilarious, and we are both willing
                                    to hinge our entire business models on the production of gag merch.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    But this does not mean I made these shirts INSTEAD of other cool HS
                                    shirts. You will note that there is a separate store called What
                                    Pumpkin. This is the store I use for the rather extensive collection of
                                    potential HS merch when we get the time to make/restock it.
                                    Realistically, there are just too many possible HS products to bug
                                    Jeffrey with all the time, since he is servicing about 30 other webcomis
                                    too, so generally I reserve WP for these ideas, while keeping Topatoco
                                    mostly about PS stuff, and now it seems SBaHJ stuff as well.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    There&#39;ll be more HS stuff in the WP store pretty soon, plus a restocking of what&#39;s
                                    there.

                                    The terms are not synonymous.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Where is trolling involved when Dave makes self-aware references to the
                                    callback heavy style of the story&#39;s construction? Where is the intent to
                                    agitate? There is no editorial subtext. There is nothing to read
                                    between the lines. There is no veiled repudiation, and I am not saying
                                    &quot;suck it bitches!&quot; to those who disagree with the callback saturation
                                    (those people don&#39;t even exist). It is merely a couple of lines of
                                    dialogue which are silly and self referential. It is a joke.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    It is also not trolling when I leave something on a cliffhanger. It is
                                    standard dramatic practice. It is also fairly unavoidable when there are
                                    many story threads running at once. You have to switch to others at
                                    some point. You also cannot answer every question at once or distribute
                                    every payoff when they are demanded, or a very nonlinear story would
                                    become very linear very quickly. It is additionally unavoidable because
                                    there are few occasions when you don&#39;t want to know what happens next.
                                    Hence every switch of focus begins to resemble a cliffhanger. This
                                    pattern has also been brought to attention through self aware humor, a
                                    la 5x cliffhanger combo gags and such. This does not count as trolling
                                    either. These are yet more gags of self reference. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    There are some moments when trolling comes into play. When tension
                                    mounts in a scene and we are being lead to expect something significant,
                                    and then you read the word &quot;psyche&quot;, that is clearly a form of
                                    trolling. When I am dressed up as a troll, and copying large volumes of
                                    text into the narrative specifically to spite you, the reader, and I am
                                    saying &quot;I am trolling you right now by doing this&quot; it is safe to say you
                                    are being trolled. And even this flagrant gesture is one step removed
                                    from the act of genuine trolling, through the partition of satire. The
                                    entire concept of trolling has been folded into the story as another
                                    source of raw material for absurd kinds of exploitation, like computer
                                    science, alchemy, sprawling chess metaphors, and suit-based alien
                                    romance. This does not mean every joke is an act of trolling, or
                                    meta-trolling. In fact, very few are. When you read a simple
                                    self-referential joke or have your expectations subverted in in some way
                                    and say HUSSIE&#39;S TROLLING US AGAIN, you sound silly. You sound like you
                                    don&#39;t understand what trolling is, or what I&#39;m actually doing here.

                                    These key dates have actually become EXTREMELY DIFFICULT to nail as the
                                    complexity of the projects increases. Problem Sleuth was very easy to
                                    key into exactly one year, because the increments were so much simpler.
                                    That year-run was the precedent that began most of this milestone
                                    madness, and I&#39;ve kept up with the milestones for the most part, but
                                    they start slipping over time. I&#39;ve already blown a few and had to
                                    readjust.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Remember that [S] Descend (end act 4) was originally targeted for
                                    4/13/10, but I ran out of time (EXACTLY like I am now) and I put [S]
                                    Jack: Ascend on that date instead. Descend got pushed way back because
                                    there was no reason to push it so hard anymore. It dropped around June,
                                    then Hivebent started on 6/12, which is now ANOTHER key date!<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Things tend to take longer than I think, whether it&#39;s a single animation
                                    task, or the execution of a string of story events, which are necessary
                                    to complete to set up other major events like an end of act, and so on.
                                    Meanwhile, time just rages on. I remember thinking at the beginning of
                                    &#39;11 that there seemed like plenty of time to set everything up to end it
                                    on 4/13. Lo and behold it&#39;s already fucking april! We&#39;ve made plenty of
                                    progress, but it&#39;s still not there.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Try to remember that as a key date approaches, I actually have much less
                                    time to make that work than it seems. To make 4/13 work for EOA5, I&#39;d
                                    need AT LEAST a solid week to work on it, probably more. Which means I&#39;d
                                    have to get the story up to that exact precipice in less than a week
                                    from now, and frankly, I&#39;ve got other shit to do. As it is, I&#39;ll be
                                    lucky to pull off anything of significance on the strike of 4/13, let
                                    alone the monstrosity that the EOA would inevitably be. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    It&#39;ll be just like EOA4 (Descend). It&#39;ll only happen when it can feasibly, logically
                                    happen.

                                    It was originally going to have another scene following the
                                    stair climb, but that turned out to be too much to cram into one page,
                                    and I thought it would have delayed the the release of the page too
                                    much. It had already been delayed enough, not only by the labor involved
                                    in making such a thing, but by the fact that I&#39;ve been pretty busy
                                    otherwise. This was not blasted out at the usual rate, neither by me nor
                                    Gankro (the programmer). We both had stuff to do.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I decided to separate the following segment onto another page to follow
                                    it shortly. It only seems abrupt because you cannot yet turn the page. I
                                    think this should be obvious.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    If you&#39;re reading a novel, you would never say &quot;man, I sure did enjoy
                                    page 386. Page 386 was just so awesome until it ended abruptly! What
                                    gives??&quot; What gives is that page 386 ran out of paper for words, and the
                                    story continued to glide seamlessly onto page 387, for those bold
                                    enough to turn and continue reading. Even for those who bookmarked and
                                    continued a couple days later! Single pages do not give you all the
                                    answers you want, nor do atomic story units in formats less
                                    conventional.<br>

                                    Sure. And I think this is because of the diversity in the story.
                                    I think if I wanted to do something more formal, that stays in more
                                    clearly defined lanes like strictly humorous or dramatic or such, that
                                    work would be stronger because I&#39;ve already tried so much with this. I&#39;d
                                    just have to reel it in. There are many things going on here that you
                                    would never see in such a work. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I&#39;m sure some look at the diversity of what&#39;s here, perceive various
                                    violations in literary protocol, and regard this as evidence of
                                    storytelling deficiency on my part. Which is fair, because you can only
                                    go on what you see. But at the same time I do have a grasp over what
                                    I&#39;ve made, and have the awareness to apply more focus to a work than
                                    what&#39;s projected through this wide aperture. When tightened, most of
                                    those violations would vanish.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I&#39;m not trying to make the best thing ever here. Only something which is
                                    very fun, extremely flexible, and serving to accelerate my abilities,
                                    my understanding of what a story can be, and my grasp on how people
                                    react to things. That is actually a valuable part of the exercise,
                                    watching mass reactions in real time, on every aspect of each update.
                                    From the minutia, to the big plot turns. There is a very real component
                                    of this that resembles a huge social experiment. I&#39;m not just putting
                                    pressure on the limits of a story&#39;s format. I appear to be doing this
                                    with the psyche of the readership as well. I have discovered many
                                    obscure buttons which can be pushed. I am taking extensive notes.

                                    I&#39;m working on a project, and I&#39;m compelled to drop every cool idea I
                                    have into it. I horse around with format, and break or bend many rules
                                    on story construction purposefully. This includes infusing it with meta
                                    elements. The meta-saturation of the story continues to fuel my
                                    interaction with the readers, and listening/responding to them probably
                                    keeps the relationship between the narrative and the reader still
                                    feeling like it is an open channel, even though suggestions have been
                                    closed for a while.<br>

                                    Everything going on here is experimental and vigorously informal, and this is the
                                    consequence.

                                    I think there is definitely hyperbole that gets thrown around
                                    when discussing my ability, and I think people tend to drastically
                                    underestimate how ridiculously good the various masters were at their
                                    crafts.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    In fact, I really don&#39;t even view myself as a writer. I view myself as
                                    more of an illustrator who tells stories, and uses as many tools at my
                                    disposal to do so. Writing is one. Drawing and animating are others. The
                                    act of telling a story is in essence writing, so that&#39;s clearly what
                                    I&#39;m doing, but it&#39;s still hard to feel like this describes my primary
                                    discipline. I&#39;ve always identified myself as an artist foremost, who&#39;s
                                    had to push into the territory of a writer and develop those skills out
                                    of the necessity that follows unchecked creative ambitions.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I also think there&#39;s the risk of media-chafing when selecting such names
                                    for comparison. Those writers were established in very formal literary
                                    traditions. I wonder what it would look like if you took one of the
                                    names you mentioned, dropped him in this period in his prime, and
                                    assigned him with a project similar to this? Some satirical, slapdash,
                                    media-blurring THING, heavily illustrated and published as fast as it
                                    was made with little revision? What if Vonnegut wanted to do that,
                                    bought a Wacom and boned up on Flash, and was TURNED LOOSE? Would he
                                    knock your socks off? Maybe!!! Kind of interesting to think about.

                                    But the silent Flashes in question are very short. There are no
                                    suitable songs on hand for things like that. Shortening songs often
                                    feels like butchering them to me.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    This issue is a little more complex than just saying &quot;hey slap a song in there, why
                                    not!&quot;<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Practically every song available already is a pretty long composition,
                                    which requires an intensive animation project. I prefer to be sparing
                                    with those, because they are difficult. If I make a very short Flash in
                                    lieu of a GIF, there will not be a song ready that is suitable. I can
                                    get someone to make something for it in advance, but that takes time,
                                    and defeats the spontaneous, rapid fire nature of such updates.
                                    Musicians can make suitable tracks after it is finished and posted, and I
                                    can go back and &quot;retcon&quot; it in. And I HAVE done this before!!! But I
                                    don&#39;t know if I want to make it a policy. It doesn&#39;t feel right slapping
                                    sound on everything retroactively simply because I can.

                                    I find it much more understandable for someone to read SBaHJ and
                                    not be into HS. Reading and appreciating HS is a very intensive process
                                    which requires a lot of time and concentration.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Whereas reading HS while not studying (yes studying) SBaHJ is less
                                    forgivable. SBaHJ is requisite supplementary reading. If HS was a class,
                                    I would automatically fail anybody who didn&#39;t get an A on their SBaHJ
                                    exam.

                                    SBaHJ is absolutely inseparable from HS, and has been almost
                                    from the start. If you don&#39;t understand this, then you don&#39;t understand
                                    HS very well. SBaHJ is like the mentally handicapped step brother of
                                    MSPA, requiring special attention, but no less cherished as a part of
                                    the family. It was originally intended as the chief source of in-house
                                    memes for dialogue, but this is ultimately a superficial purpose. Though
                                    it only has 20+ strips, it contains a pretty dense and internally
                                    consistent language of recurring symbols and typo-driven grammars,
                                    applicable as a rich sub-cognitive lexicon for highlighting elusive
                                    elements woven into the mythology of the story which tend to be shrouded
                                    in the unconscious. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Many times events in SBaHJ &quot;foreshadow&quot; what happens in HS, but this is
                                    practically never intentional. It is always retroactive on my part, and
                                    quite convenient. Like the vampire strip I drew shortly before Kanaya&#39;s
                                    death and resurrection. The correlation was convenient, and was
                                    emphasized in the comic as a gag. Same with the one with Bro achieving
                                    LIFDOFF, passing a cloud labeled &quot;cloun&quot;. Soon after, John flew his car
                                    by a cloud that showed Gamzee in it. This was unintentional while
                                    drawing the SBaHJ, but the connection was soon made in the comic
                                    serendipitously. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    SBaHJ as a creative process is probably a pretty accurate reflection of
                                    my subconscious at work. This may be why it often ties into HS themes
                                    yet to develop. It is like I am a prophet of my own story, and these
                                    shitty comics are my cryptic messages. I submit to the trance of the
                                    JPEGothics, while quaking in the losseldritch throes of the artifact
                                    tongues. The resulting imagery is troubling, and AGGRESSIVELY PREGNANT
                                    with meaning.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Though most aspects of HS&#39;s story construction is exceedingly
                                    meticulous, with multi-threaded plot connections established months or
                                    years in advance, intuition plays a powerful role too, and may be even
                                    more important than the maniacal, overly cerebral stuff. There are
                                    occasions where something will just FIT, in a weirdly perfect way, even
                                    though I didn&#39;t quite intend it. I always seems to be working favorably
                                    with the grain of positive coincidence. Strange things with numbers
                                    happen all the time, for example, and this is certainly not because I&#39;m a
                                    skilled numerologist. The troll&#39;s number is 612 because I started
                                    Hivebent on 6/12, a tale of 12 6 sweep-olds (13 year-olds). Their names
                                    are 6 and 6 letters, like mine. Why is one sweep = 2.16 years? Weird.
                                    Why is 6/12/11 exactly one sweep from 4/13/09, the start date of HS???
                                    Also weird. These occurrences are everywhere, and I can only assume they
                                    have their root in the turbulent void from which all this comes. The
                                    story is in part driven furiously by high level cerebral machinations,
                                    and in part at the mercy of the whims of my waking coma. And I,
                                    personally, am at the mercy of it all.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Anyway, if for no other reason, this is why you should like SBaHJ, or at
                                    least find it intriguing. Frankly, I am quite suspicious of anyone who
                                    doesn&#39;t find it funny. I am suspicious of their judgment and quality of
                                    perception. This is probably because it means their minds are
                                    incompatible with mine on a such a profound level. They are at odds with
                                    my subconscious.

                                        you&#39;re just making it up as you go along, but then you show

                                    There is a lot to it. I don&#39;t have any trade secrets at all, but
                                    if I did, it would probably be the process I apply to those images.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    One major tactic: save as jpg, reduce quality to zero, but DON&#39;T SAVE IT
                                    YET. Instead, screen capture the preview. Then paste that into the same
                                    document, and repeat this process for a while, until you have grown the
                                    desired amount of &quot;loss scum&quot;.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    But this just keeps making the image foggier, which isn&#39;t good enough by
                                    itself. After that, I usually apply other effects, like strategic
                                    sharpenings and other misc. filters. I also use a lot of masking through
                                    color range selections, and perform meticulous alterations at the
                                    pixel-cluster level.

                                    I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the opposite, but it&#39;s obviously intended
                                    as an absurd transformation to specifically complement Kanaya&#39;s.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    &quot;Going grimdark&quot; is a phrase which itself is silly enough to qualify as a
                                    joke. The ramifications of such a transformation are surely on par with
                                    becoming a glowing Twilight-esque vampire called a rainbow drinker. And
                                    yet, silly though these developments are, no one can argue they are not
                                    awesome as well. The result is the magic which takes place when stupid
                                    meets badass.<br>

                                    The whole &quot;going grimdark&quot; thing was something discussed by readers when
                                    Rose first started stirring things up with her dark magic. The whole
                                    issue was later lampooned somewhat in a conversation with John. In fact,
                                    practically every line of the recent updates have been callbacks to
                                    this conversation. <br>

                                    I found the point of controversy kind of funny. It makes one wonder,
                                    what does &quot;going grimdark&quot; even mean? Is that even a thing? I guess it
                                    is, as long as we understand that it probably refers to the
                                    metamorphosis of a vanilla character into a brooding gothic cliche, and
                                    this is something played absolutely straight in things which are
                                    generally terrible. Please note it is not being played straight in this
                                    case. [AND YET IT IS. WINK.]<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Also, who here is keeping tabs on super hero references??<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Rose&#39;s shirt has somewhat resembled the Punisher&#39;s logo for some time
                                    now, without any reason to link her to the vigilante. Let us now note
                                    the origin of the Punisher, a guy spurred to vengeance after watching
                                    his family get brutally murdered.

                                    There was a small liberty taken with perspective.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    If you look at the beam of light coming out of the record, that beam is
                                    pointing straight up. If skaia were directly above that record, the beam
                                    of light would lead to it. It doesn&#39;t.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Skaia is directly over Dave&#39;s house. She is looking at it from a vantage
                                    similar to how we&#39;d view the north star. But again, with some
                                    perspective liberties taken.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    This is because it just reads better this way. Our understanding is, skaia is &quot;up&quot;.
                                    To go to it, you fly up. <br>

                                    <br>
                                    <a class="nofollow" href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002401" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002401</a><br>
                                    <br>
                                    With these little Rose flashes, I just thought the idea would be a
                                    little easier to get across with a short flash than a series of gifs.
                                    They were not really long enough in my mind before execution to warrant
                                    finding a clip, or asking someone to make something beforehand.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The one where she looks in the cue ball wound up being a little longer
                                    than I thought it would, just to pace it right, and I certainly COULD
                                    have given it some track with suitable ambiance, but I sort of
                                    deliberately checked that impulse.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I just don&#39;t think that necessarily EVERYTHING is going to benefit from
                                    sound, even though it sure looks like that&#39;s the pattern I&#39;ve
                                    established. If every time that preloader pops up, even if only to serve
                                    a 15 second clip meant for sequential utility, and we&#39;re hearing a tiny
                                    mood setting score or little sound effects each time just cause that&#39;s
                                    what a flash Has To Be, then it feels like it&#39;s getting into hokey
                                    territory to me. For the larger cinematic pieces, yes those absolutely
                                    need sound. The mini ones? Ehhhh, not so much. In any case, the
                                    expectation that sound must be delivered with flash or I risk violating
                                    my rules is something I find a little bothersome.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The line has been pushed very far into some vague mediaspace frontier.
                                    But now and then, I like to remind you that the story still includes
                                    every possibility up to that line, including the more primitive things
                                    far short of it.

                                    I understand what you mean, and thanks, but I guess there are different types of
                                    &quot;wow factors&quot;.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    At this point I believe the kind you are talking about is a typical
                                    reaction to something with strong cinematics conveying interesting
                                    developments. That&#39;s cool and all, don&#39;t get me wrong.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The kind I was talking about was more palpable during ones like WV:
                                    Ascend, where the reaction is based on lack of precedent, and the
                                    reaction is something like &quot;I didn&#39;t know this could be that.&quot; Some
                                    successive ones had that feel too, like Descend probably, and the first
                                    Alterniabound probably did too somewhat, in that the format was such a
                                    curve ball. Innovation is still possible, but like I said, there is some
                                    element of diminishing returns to this kind of thing. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I&#39;m not saying this quality is essential to preserve in continuing that
                                    kind of output, but its evaporation in a project like this does steal a
                                    liiiittle motivation for going to the bother. Like I said, I&#39;ll do them
                                    if I get an idea that sounds like a fun and a worthwhile way to apply
                                    time. Which actually isn&#39;t much different from how I&#39;ve been doing it
                                    lately anyway.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    And somewhere in this equation is the fact that at some point this thing
                                    does have to GET MOVING, and Flash projects have notoriously
                                    bottlenecked story progress behind them.

                                    Let&#39;s try to come to our senses here. The labor involved in
                                    making a Flash animation is pretty goddamn ridiculous. I&#39;m approaching
                                    the 2 year mark on Homestuck, and in addition to the thousands of static
                                    pages and many tens of thousands of words, I am standing on several
                                    hours of animated footage. This is, frankly, ludicrous. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Not that there is any regret in this accumulation. But after a point, an
                                    assessment has to be made whether such sustained high intensity is
                                    worthwhile, and whether it continues serving the purpose it originally
                                    had. It&#39;s purposes being media exploration, pushing the envelope on
                                    story delivery, and so on. The envelope can&#39;t always be pushed farther
                                    while still justifying the effort. If the effort required increases,
                                    while reader reaction inevitably flattens and adjusts to the
                                    expectation, then that particular purpose is not really being satisfied
                                    anymore. As far as media exploration goes, I think there&#39;s probably more
                                    than enough dynamism in the animated portion of this work to cover my
                                    initial agenda for it (which is to say, it far surpasses it). And as
                                    reader reaction catalysts, they probably stopped having the eye-widening
                                    impact they once had, where they were very often transforming your
                                    understanding of what this story was, and what it could be, and catching
                                    people off guard by humbling what preceded it. Without that
                                    experiential payload, they become a part of a pretty homogeneous loaf
                                    that represents MSPA as a product, something that demands a consistent
                                    mouth feel when chewed, and Flash must be tasted before swallowed. This
                                    is a situation I am not HUUUGELY interested in committing all of my time
                                    to keeping propped up, and Flash animations were not actually meant to
                                    be part of MSPA&#39;s Pledge To The Consumer.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    So all that&#39;s really left, and this has been true for a while I guess,
                                    is whether I feel like doing a Flash and whether I&#39;ll enjoy it. I can
                                    say that the end to every act will definitely involve a Flash animation.
                                    But beyond that, I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s possible I might not do a Flash
                                    between now and the end of A5. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Or I might! We&#39;ll see.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    But what might not be fruitful is trying to read the gaps in my schedule
                                    like tea leaves, and divine the nature of upcoming output. Often, in
                                    the Flash frenzied history of HS&#39;s reckless climb, interpreting such
                                    gaps in this way has been reliable. Maybe not so much here on out!

                                    presumed due to ignorance. Aradia knew what the scratch was (since she
                                    was the one who first mentioned it in her private memo), but she was not
                                    all that talkative as a mopey robot, and clearly didn&#39;t think it was
                                    important enough to let anyone know.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    We now know the scratch isn&#39;t what transported Jack between sessions. We don&#39;t know
                                    what did yet.

                                    With Scratch, I think one of the fun things about his recent
                                    developments is that they came on the heels of learning that he is part
                                    Cal. His identity as a creepy pervert wasn&#39;t exactly &quot;set up&quot; before
                                    this revelation. Not overtly. But if it was I think it would be less
                                    entertaining. We get to watch certain traits of his personality reveal
                                    themselves exactly when we now have reason to expect those traits. If he
                                    had them before it might have weakened the humor value of it now, even
                                    though it would have been more air tight from a characterization and
                                    plot construction standpoint. We didn&#39;t get to say &quot;DIABOLICAL! So
                                    THAT&#39;S why he&#39;s a perv!&quot; But HS has enough of those eureka moments
                                    already for us to be worrying about that.<br>

                                    Not that his developments are completely off the wall either. He was
                                    always a pretty self satisfied guy, with the demeanor of someone who
                                    could easily be a coy prankster, who just hadn&#39;t revealed those
                                    tendencies yet. Much of what he said had the feel of a knowitall who&#39;s
                                    just messing with someone. Also, he did only talk to the girls. With the
                                    exception of the one short line to Karkat. He manipulated them and
                                    mentored them in weird ways, and eventually one might ask, why all the
                                    attention on the ladies dude??? So turns out that&#39;s why, sort of. Of
                                    course the original reason was more pragmatic. It was just that of all
                                    the trolls, the ones most relevant and dynamic in the story tended to be
                                    girls, so that&#39;s who he talked to. But later, it struck me as a pretty
                                    amusing angle on an omniscient character to be a bit of a creeper, and
                                    this is in keeping with his origin. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Remember where Cal came from in the first place? And why he was thrown out of Dave&#39;s
                                    dream tower?<br>
                                    <br>
                                    <a class="nofollow" href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003621" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003621</a><br>

                                    But all that said I still don&#39;t think it&#39;s quite right to regard him as
                                    an actual pedophile, just because of what sort of entity he is. It&#39;s
                                    probably more apt to think of him as an all knowing supercomputer that
                                    happens to have a gravitation toward young ladies in his programming.
                                    Imagine walking up to the computer and if you are a boy it says, hey.
                                    But if you are a girl it says WELL HELLO, DON&#39;T YOU LOOK NICE. Thinking
                                    of it in these terms helps make it funny rather than outright
                                    disturbing.

                                    others (which, hey! has a SCRATCH in it. ehhh?) 8r8k is a word commonly
                                    used by Vriska, as a word meaning fortune (8ad 8r8k) and also something
                                    she literally does to 8 balls. t1CK t0ck has significance to Aradia as
                                    the Maid of Time, clearly. It has significance to Tavros and his

                                    unambiguously tied to the ticking clock in the belly of the crocodile
                                    who hunts Captain Hook. And Captain Hook has been unambiguously likened

                                    most of Scratch&#39;s DNA comes from the honk code. Bec&#39;s DNA comes from the

                                    A small exception to the pattern. But we can examine a few reasons why it makes
                                    sense.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Aradia&#39;s quirk is to replace &#39;o&#39; with &#39;0&#39;, making t0ck. Using a &#39;1&#39; for
                                    t1ck not only balances the numerology, but adds a binary element to the
                                    phrase. Duality/bifurcation has always been a strong theme in the
                                    trolls&#39; session. Two teams, two sets of ruins, two universes.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    There is also a pretty solid case to be made for why Tavros should
                                    represent 1. Aradia has always used zeroes because she had been the
                                    &quot;null character&quot;, before her resurrection. Sollux on the other hand had
                                    always been the character of duality, with his twofold curse. When
                                    Aradia came back to life, she lost her null quality, and thus lost her
                                    quirk. Sollux lost his twofold curse when he went blind, and lost his
                                    quirk too. But he, in a way, assumed Aradia&#39;s position as the null
                                    character, insofar as 2-2=0. He assumed her quirk. This is aside from
                                    the point about Tavros though. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    If you list the trolls according to the order of the zodiac, it starts with:<br>
                                    <br>
                                    0: Aradia<br>
                                    1: Tavros<br>
                                    2: Sollux<br>
                                    <br>
                                    That is, if beginning with 0, which is suitable for Aradia&#39;s theme, then
                                    Sollux is also numbered suitably as well. That makes Tavros the 1 troll
                                    by default. Does the number 1 have significance for his character
                                    beyond this? Bet you can think of your own reasons if I left you to it.
                                    Here&#39;s a pretty good one for me: Tavros is so lame, he&#39;s always
                                    forgotten to type with the number ruling his existence, and it is only
                                    through writing this code that the quirk has been awakened.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Vriska&#39;s number is obviously 8. Scorpio is in fact the eighth sign on
                                    the list too, assuming we switch to begin counting at 1 from the start
                                    in this case. Which we should, because we aren&#39;t actually being that
                                    literal about assigning a number to each troll. It only makes sense for a
                                    few of them. Some of their numbers don&#39;t even register on a 1-12 scale.
                                    Equius likes 100, while Nepeta is all about 33.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    8 has always been kind of a special number in HS, in the same way 413
                                    has, though not hit as hard as those digits have been. In fact, 4+1+3=8!
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    413 are Terezi&#39;s numbers. She uses them as her quirk, as the numerals of
                                    the blind prophets. If we are to say Vriska is 8, then Terezi is right
                                    behind her on the zodiac list, and she would be 7.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Her code &quot;H34DS&quot; conveniently includes no 1. 3+4=7!!! There&#39;s her number, rearing
                                    its head.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Where did the 1 go? Tavros has it! It seems writing these codes while
                                    sleepwalking has cajoled the true numbers assigned to Tavros and Terezi,
                                    1 and 7, out of their subconscious. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Ok, so some of this sounds a bit like hand waving I&#39;m sure. No single
                                    reason here is ESPECIALLY compelling for giving Tavros a 1 on its own,
                                    but I submit that we have overwhelmed the jury with circumstantial
                                    evidence, and I expect a conviction.

                                    really how I worked. I littered the story with hundreds of details,
                                    knowing that some of them would rise to extreme significance later. The
                                    bunny was one such detail designed explicitly to rise to significance,
                                    though in a way left open ended. Cal was exactly the same. But for those

                                    Ok, here is what I said about this in the forum.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    vvv<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Here comes the magic of logic.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Four codes does not necessarily mean a more complicated genetic code, or some kind
                                    of weird alien DNA.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Symbols are just symbols. With the MEOW code, the DNA letters were not
                                    literally MEOW. They represented GCAT. M=G, E=C, O=A, W=T.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Same with these codes, but more symbols can be mapped to GCAT at the
                                    same time. Like t1CK=GCAT, t0ck=GCAT, 8rk=GCA, H34DS=TGCAT. This will
                                    work as long as the total number of symbols is divisible by 4*.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The means of creating the code is more complex, but the code itself is not
                                    necessarily.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Not that I am expecting this to occur to most people though. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    *Addendum:<br>
                                    <br>
                                    When I wrote that, the honk codes had not been revealed yet. So
                                    additionally, honk =GCAT, HONK=GCAT. An additional 8 symbols, also
                                    divisible by 4 to ensure balanced GCAT distribution. Each part is needed
                                    to combine to form what is presumably the equivalent of the MEOW code,
                                    once translated to GCAT.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    This makes for a total of 24 symbols to complete Scratch&#39;s code. Is this
                                    relevant? Why don&#39;t I point this out. It&#39;s actually 2 sets of 12, one
                                    for each troll, and one for each ancestor, who were created all together
                                    in their session by Karkat. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    If you want to keep your theorist&#39;s cap on, you could then note that the
                                    MEOW code only consists of 4 symbols, one for each kid, but not for
                                    each guardian as well. It might suggest there are missing symbols, and
                                    we don&#39;t know the full story about Bec&#39;s origin. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    It MIGHT.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Or might not.<br>
                                    <br>

                                    I think this was pretty obvious a long time ago.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    But then, homosexuality in a society where bisexuality is the norm is
                                    kind of a different thing. Rather than being a swapped preference, it is
                                    a more exacting preference. Somewhat like a fetish for a particular
                                    gender. When Karkat was talking to John about it, he indicated trolls
                                    don&#39;t even have a word for the orientation. It&#39;s not something that
                                    appears to have any cultural significance to them. Which might seem odd,
                                    but then, they&#39;re aliens. Maybe a way to view it is how we view people
                                    with more exacting preferences, like certain fetishists. We don&#39;t
                                    actually have common words to describe most people like that, and their
                                    presence doesn&#39;t have nearly the same social ramifications which
                                    homosexuality does. Humans seem to make a very big deal out of
                                    homosexuality, while treating other forms of preference as barely worth
                                    noting. When Karkat was &lt;3&lt; hitting on John, the reasonable human
                                    response was to say &quot;I am not a homosexual.&quot; But the troll response
                                    would be more like &quot;Sorry, not interested,&quot; without invoking
                                    orientation. Very much like a guy with a fat fetish isn&#39;t too likely to
                                    reject a thin girl by saying &quot;Sorry, I am just this HUGE chubby chaser,
                                    so I must decline.&quot; (CUE FAT VRISKA JOKES AGAIN)<br>

                                    MSPAspace is a pretty fast and loose kind of space. <br>

                                    I like to think the events you described would have taken a month to convey through
                                    a more typical webcomic.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    And by that I mean what I just said is definitely true.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Also a typical comic would not involve things that are as great as those things.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Basically I am saying there is a good reason why this is the only comic that you
                                    bother with.<br>

                                    It was intentional insofar as I was aware of the possibility of
                                    drawing attention to it for humorous effect, but did not.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    There was already a Schrodinger&#39;s Dave joke earlier, and how much lousy
                                    Schrodinger do we even need? That one was funnier anyway, because it was
                                    Ricky Schroedinger&#39;s Dave, which is not actually funny to anyone who
                                    doesn&#39;t know what Silver Spoons was, which is probably most of you. And
                                    even then, it is only funny in conjunction with Terezi&#39;s breakdancing
                                    Schroeder gifs.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    So what I&#39;m saying is the cat joke both exists and doesn&#39;t exist. It is in fact
                                    Schrodinger&#39;s Joke.

                                    But for the record she doesn&#39;t sparkle, she just glows like a goddamn
                                    light bulb, which is WAY more awesome than Edward turning into a walking
                                    blingee when he gets some sun. It also makes more sense because she is a
                                    reverse vampire on account of being a member of a nocturnal race. And
                                    it makes even MORE sense because it is a dig at Twilight.<br>

                                    Stephenie Meyer can&#39;t even fall back on the Twilight parody excuse to
                                    justify her glittering vampires, because the thing she is writing is
                                    Twilight in the first place. I am going to email her my condolences.
                                    She&#39;ll probably think I&#39;m retarded though, sort of like how I feel about
                                    people who complain about my dumb shit on formspring. The only
                                    significant difference is that I&#39;m right, and she&#39;s boring.

                                    reading which demand this [S] page should have gratified them all
                                    instantly in the exact way they desired, so I&#39;ll answer them
                                    blanketedly.<br>

                                    Have you ever watched a movie? Sometimes the setup is as important as
                                    the payoff. Ambiance? Tone? Suspense? Bringing to a more clear cinematic
                                    focus of prior events? Any of these things familiar?<br>
                                    <br>
                                    If we chopped up an old western into pieces and distributed it daily,
                                    all those cowboy actors have to put up with Formspring questions yelling
                                    GET FUCKING ON WITH IT CLINT EASTWOOD. WE GET IT, YOU ARE STARING THE
                                    DUDE DOWN. Things take time to execute and deliver properly.<br>

                                    I think sometimes people think this site is this magic box that all this
                                    miraculous shit comes out of with no explanation or process behind it,
                                    but I do in fact have to spend time MAKING that shit. The more complex
                                    it is, and the more points of interest it resolves, the more time it
                                    takes. You wanted a fucking battle royale? Ok, get ready for a week
                                    without updates!<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The golden goose is a great thing for everybody until down the road you
                                    discover you are that guy wringing the bird&#39;s neck screaming at it to
                                    lay you some more goddamn eggs you honking piece of shit.

                                    her powers in battle and romance.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    This is one of those things that is equal parts serious and silly (well
                                    ok maybe not totally equal). It is in part serious in the sense that you
                                    can view it totally straight and read it as a series of events that
                                    literally happened, and has implications for the story. It is also in
                                    part COMPLETELY FUCKING RIDICULOUS because you are truly, literally
                                    reading an excerpt of trashy romance, involving pirates like some Fabio
                                    novel, all parsed through a grim troll culture and the strange
                                    multi-dimensionality of troll romance.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Once all the dust WTF settles, you can look at it from a variety of angles.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Since this is the ancestor Vriska idolizes, this is probably the exact
                                    type of character she&#39;d grow up to be, if left unfettered in troll
                                    society. If there is any departure in her inclinations, this is the
                                    template she is departing from. We&#39;ve already seen her try to do her
                                    Mindfang impression a few times with mixed results. She tried to get
                                    Tavros to kiss her with mind control, but couldn&#39;t go through with it.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    When put into the perspective of more severe adult troll attitudes, I
                                    think it helps make everything the trolls have done so far seem more
                                    childish in retrospect. It was hard to gauge, because adult troll life
                                    was completely abstract. Hearing a little from one adult&#39;s perspective
                                    through this romfic shows how big the gap was between their youthful
                                    antics and what they were really trying to become.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    It also puts a little perspective on why certain relationships are the
                                    way they are, seeing how their ancestral counterparts interacted (in
                                    this case, Vriska and Eridan, whose ancestor was Dualscar, which was the
                                    name of his RP character as well). But we still only have the one
                                    example to go on so far.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    And on the topic of Vriska reading this thing for inspiration, to me
                                    it&#39;s kind of got the feel of a cross between a kid learning about a
                                    relative she looks up to, delighting in reading some unapologetically
                                    trashy romance novel, AND the troll equivalent of stumbling on her
                                    parent&#39;s porn stash. Which is not to say the entire journal is full of
                                    smut. But hey, there it is.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    And lastly, you can look at the log as further insight into the nature
                                    of troll romance, their near-universal bisexuality, their apparently
                                    casual attitudes toward the multiple partners the quadrants demand, the
                                    tension surrounding the potential of hopping quadrants and the meaning
                                    of envy in this regard, an element of mysterious affection that still
                                    seems to surround the hate-based black relationships, and a certain
                                    degree of open promiscuity implied by the actions here. IF YOU CARE!

                                    Well, if you have to force a punchline, then the punchline
                                    shouldn&#39;t even exist, should it? The whole comic shouldn&#39;t exist. By
                                    extension, there are entire webcomics out there that should not exist.
                                    (Won&#39;t say which ones tho! hehehehehehehehehehe.)<br>
                                    <br>
                                    But really, one problem with normal comics I think is when you have
                                    pages chock full of panels, sometimes a lot of those panels just get
                                    glazed over by the reader as background wallpaper, even though they may
                                    be very attractive if examined, and a great deal of care was put into it
                                    by the artist. It&#39;s sort of a shame.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    With each panel given focus, they demand attention and can have more
                                    power individually, and create more surprising statements as navigated
                                    through. This is true even if one of my panels is literally just me
                                    scribbling bullshit all over it.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    And the real HAYMAKER of this format is being able to deliver any
                                    quantity of text below the image I want. Anywhere from 0 to 100,000
                                    characters. I can fit entire conversations in one panel which would
                                    require HUNDREDS of normal comic panels to convey gracefully. I always
                                    found dialogue-dense comics a bit offputting, wherein all the dialogue
                                    is stuffed into a lot of ponderous bubbles crowding out the art. With
                                    this format, this is not an issue at all. Large volumes of text may
                                    coexist with the art innocuously, as if you are reading a true
                                    comic/novel hybrid.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Oh yeah, + animation&#39;s cool too I guess.

                                    write a book called &quot;Ruining Comics: Forever&quot;. It will be a 1000 page
                                    book, and every page will simply be a photograph of my face.

                                    The whiplash phenomenon is not limited to your perception of
                                    Vriska. It is a defining feature of the reading experience, especially
                                    lately. It&#39;s not a bad thing, in my view. One of the reasons you get on a
                                    roller coaster is because the experience is not exactly a gentle one.
                                    They build them in amusement parks, because that is where people go to
                                    be amused.<br>

                                    Vriska is not designed to be either definitively likable or hateable.
                                    Sometimes when you read a story, a character does something which you
                                    will take as a message from the author about how you are supposed to
                                    feel about that character. When they later do something at odds with
                                    that message, it can either be regarded as out of character, or
                                    character development, depending on both the reader&#39;s perception, and
                                    the author&#39;s execution.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    In this case, everything she does, good or bad, is meant to provide a
                                    more complete picture of her as a character, and more thorough context
                                    for her actions. Once upon a time, a lot of it seemed purely despicable.
                                    But I don&#39;t believe either extreme, despicable or sympathetic, is 100%
                                    suitable anymore. What exists is a portrait that has complexities, as
                                    any character given a lot of time in the limelight should have. That
                                    having been provided, which side she falls on is up to the reader.

                                    I am prioritizing that the story continue to be entertaining and
                                    funny. That is what it still is, in my view, which appears to differ
                                    with the reality inside your own personal factsphere. So be it.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    But using Problem Sleuth as a comparison is silly. Problem Sleuth had
                                    very little in the way of a plot, and the characters were mute foils for
                                    outrageous shenanigans. The dark events, which were rare, happened in a
                                    framework in which investment was limited. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The Midnight Crew intermission would serve as a better comparison
                                    anyway, since it was essentially a bloodbath. But it&#39;s still the same
                                    kind of thing. Stick figure characters with no actual personality
                                    getting knocked off left and right for laughs. If you ask I apply the
                                    exact same standards of &quot;dark lite&quot; to HS, I say this is not possible.
                                    Killing a character beyond stick figure depth will necessarily carry
                                    more weight, and will be read by some as a turn for the GRIMDARK. So in
                                    truth your advice is to kill no one, and proceed gutlessly, or risk
                                    being likened to a comic book from the 1990&#39;s. I suggest viewing this as
                                    an attempt to be edgy and therefore artistic is a pretty shallow way to
                                    interpret what is happening.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Looking back on the MC intermission again, it was a pretty prescient
                                    segment. It foretold of a great deal of time travel complexity yet to
                                    come in the story. It turns out there was a bloodbath in the cards as
                                    well. There are many ways to examine past events and not be surprised by
                                    what is taking place now. Not the least of which is that these children
                                    were introduced as members of a race of psychopathic murderers. Some of

                                    something that runs the risk of getting pretty fucked up. Practically
                                    everything I&#39;ve done outside the confines of MSPA has been considerably
                                    more bizarre.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I&#39;m capable of containing the impulse to do bizarre shit when I want to.
                                    If you look at some big stretches of Homestuck, you will observe
                                    something that is quite tame, often cutesy, and even at times bordering
                                    on accessible. But then, to create a well manicured and widely palatable
                                    product was never the mission here. It was about exploration, high
                                    diversity of concepts and execution and all that, and I guess above all,
                                    fun for me personally. (and YOU!) So there are vehicles built into it
                                    to support my more usual fare. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The primary vehicle for that was Hivebent, and the entire troll presence
                                    in the story in general. It began with a pretty messed up premise. The
                                    establishment of a colorful cast of kids from a violent race of
                                    psychopaths whose entire civilization centers around brutality and
                                    murder, and watching how kids from such a culture relate to each other
                                    and come of age. Hivebent began with dark notes relative to Homestuck,
                                    and only got darker. The scene with Vriska and Tavros in her quest
                                    cocoon was an example of the escalation in fucked up shit. Present
                                    events are even further escalation. It was always going to get much
                                    worse before it got better. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    If you got into this story more recently without knowing anything about
                                    me or what I&#39;ve done before, and feel the story would be better suited
                                    without the inclusion of the more bizarre elements, or the downright
                                    NASTYTIMES, all I can say is that&#39;s not who I am or what you signed up
                                    for.<br>

                                    then I would bet there aren&#39;t many ways in which our senses of humor
                                    differ. But to many it was disturbing, hideous rubbish. In truth, these
                                    comics are probably about as unsettling as you can possibly get without
                                    resorting to violent or sexual content. (if it appears sexual in nature,
                                    that is only your imagination at work, trust me)<br>

                                    [here&#39;s where this answer probably gets a bit too long]<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I&#39;m constantly mining content from my older work to incorporate into
                                    Homestuck. The instances of this are hard to quantify. Let&#39;s talk about
                                    Equius again. Lot&#39;s of people thought he had depth beyond his gags, and
                                    that&#39;s definitely true. But that wasn&#39;t what was relevant about him, to
                                    me personally. He was always the troll personification of everything
                                    like Humanimals I ever did and put on the internet. (Hence is lusus is
                                    basically a Humanimal.) I used to do all sorts of weird stuff, reviewing
                                    obscene furry pornography, making weird collages involving horses, and
                                    just a whole lot of bizarre shit that didn&#39;t make much sense, but I
                                    thought was funny. The whole span of these endeavors was quite trollish
                                    in nature, and you will agree if you peruse Humanimals. The fact that it
                                    puts some people off is part of what makes it funny. So Equius was that
                                    entire arena of trollish content, rolled into a character. That&#39;s why I
                                    was STRONGLY committed to maintaining the integrity of his arc, as I
                                    defined it. It was more important by far for me to adhere to his role as
                                    the fucked up dude who embodies all that stuff than have him blow it by
                                    doing something heroic. He believed he died a death of supreme
                                    integrity. And so do I.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Don&#39;t get me wrong, he was still a gag character. But this was the
                                    precise nature of the gag, an homage to an entire vein of humor I used
                                    to deal in copiously. He, like some others, trolled you in life, and
                                    then trolled you in death. What happened in between, you ask? Well, that
                                    was just you falling in love.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Whistles was a graphic novel I did years ago. It&#39;s another thing I&#39;ve
                                    mined ideas from, which have specifically begun to show themselves
                                    lately with Gamzee&#39;s turn. And oddly, there&#39;s some of Whistles rolled
                                    into Equius too. If Equius seemed to accelerate to a point of depth
                                    faster than others, maybe it&#39;s because he was built on quite a payload
                                    of founding concepts, all revolving around perversity.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Whistles was about a clown in a circus who was as sweet as could be. He
                                    loved his ringmaster, in spite of the fact that the master was a
                                    cannibal and a tyrant who attempted to kill him. When the circus
                                    rebelled against the master and beat him, Whistles flipped out, killed a
                                    lot of people, and absconded with the master into the desert. (nice
                                    clown going murderous is obviously what Gamzee imported from this) The
                                    recurring theme throughout the whole comic is that every time Whistles
                                    has a chance to do the right thing and rebel against his evil master, he
                                    can&#39;t overcome his loyalty to him. To the point where he offers his
                                    starving master his own severed arm to eat. The whole thing is darkly
                                    humorous and pretty messed up. Equius imported this insane reverence for
                                    the hierarchy at the expense of his own well being. Though with
                                    Whistles, it wasn&#39;t quite as perverse and didn&#39;t have the creepy sexual
                                    connotations. (However, at one point Whistles did dabble in
                                    prostitution. But when he did it, it was cute!)<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I get asked sometimes if I will make book 2, the conclusion of Whistles.
                                    The answer is, probably not. It&#39;s incredibly time consuming making a
                                    graphic novel, and I don&#39;t know where I&#39;ll find the time. It also
                                    probably just gathered too much dust for me to get into it again. But
                                    unlike Equius, I did plan on giving Whistles a heroic end. I always
                                    intended for him to overcome his obsession with his master.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    For what it&#39;s worth, I did finish a draft of book 2&#39;s first chapter. It
                                    introduces a new villain named Sugarshoe who is, get this, another
                                    insane clown! If you read through this and recent HS events, it may seem
                                    like I&#39;m obsessed with this kind of thing. Not really. Like I said, I
                                    just borrow heavily from myself.<br>

                                    Just to wrap up this trivia binge, some other examples of old stuff I&#39;ve rolled into
                                    Homestuck are..........<br>

                                    SBaHJ. I did a few strips on a whim, satirizing someone&#39;s comics, about
                                    one month before I started HS. I folded it into HS as it&#39;s primary
                                    source of original memes to be referenced ad nauseum. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The whole Bro puppet obsession was largely sparked by this series of
                                    ridiculous muppet comics I did in the forum years ago. One of the comics
                                    actually made it in HS, pinned on Bro&#39;s door for Dave to find. File

                                    All the wizard stuff in Rose&#39;s house, and her wizardfic writing in
                                    general, was mostly imported from my own absurd wizardfic I wrote some
                                    years ago, a pretty healthy sized book I never quite finished. It was
                                    called Wizardy Herbert, and was a very flippantly satirical story about
                                    kids and magic, starting out as what seemed like an unapologetic Harry
                                    Potter spoof revolving around a magical summer camp instead of a school,
                                    and then quickly launching off the plot deep end into some very
                                    convoluted stuff of Homestuckian proportions. In fact, there are many
                                    ideas mined from this story and injected into Homestuck. Any time you
                                    read anything about magic being stupid or not being real or anything
                                    like that, that&#39;s Wizardy Herbert talking. Zazzerpan and his full
                                    Complacency were minor characters in WH. WH is actually extremely
                                    similar to HS, in terms of the nature of the dialogue, the blend of
                                    utter silliness and dramatic seriousness, and complexity. It feels like
                                    such a similar thing to me, this might be the main reason why I&#39;ll never
                                    quite finish it.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Characters from WH are on Rose&#39;s wall here. <a class="nofollow" href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002121" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002121</a><br>

                                    Herbert is the guy with the eye patch. He had a magic gun. But he could
                                    never figure out how to use magic, so he primarily just went around
                                    shooting things. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Anyway I guess that&#39;s enough about all that.

                                    whatever?? It just seemed so RANDOM! That was so cruel of you, and also

                                    These question-grievances are always no win situations. There are so
                                    many conflicting objections, it&#39;s hard to take any seriously.<br>

                                    And this isn&#39;t even addressing the substance of the objection. So you&#39;re
                                    saying there is no purpose in characterizing someone who is slated to
                                    die? Pardon me, but that&#39;s idiotic. You say you don&#39;t understand the
                                    point in taking &quot;all this time for him&quot;? Where &quot;all this time&quot; is a
                                    single Flash page, with several conversations? Seems like overstatement.
                                    As for the point of the Flash, how about fun? Entertainment value?
                                    Humor? Is any of this registering?

                                    Disappointing? I don&#39;t think so. More like suitable for everything we knew about the
                                    character. Which wasn&#39;t all that much. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    This was a character who was introduced with horse porn on his walls.
                                    His entire presence in the story was a gag. I think literally every
                                    conversation he had was centered around his obsession with the
                                    hierarchy, his perverse enjoyment in being bossed around by those under
                                    him, and his desire to be subjug(gl)ated by his only land dwelling
                                    superior. He mentioned he didn&#39;t think he could raise a hand to the
                                    highblood. When it came down to it, he couldn&#39;t, not even to save his
                                    life. Such was the extent of ridiculous submission fetish. He was
                                    devoted to the caste system to a fault, and he died for it.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    To be disappointed is to crave a more challenging or heroic death. Which
                                    I guess is fine. But to crave a scenario in which a more dynamic duel
                                    occurs and he rises as some sort of hero would be overestimating the
                                    relevance of an utterly marginal character, someone designed to be not
                                    much more than a really strange piece of an ensemble cast. What he
                                    contributed to that ensemble was, as I said, completely centered around a
                                    gag, and I stayed true to the gag to the bitter end. His death was as
                                    much a sight gag as his introduction. This effectively concludes his arc
                                    as a minor character. (OR DOES IT????)<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I think of the big picture, and like I say all the time, I consider how
                                    it reads straight through as opposed to dripped out tortuously for day
                                    to day analysis and second guessing. In the slow motion of present
                                    moment, the readers deal in countless WOULDN&#39;T IT BE COOL IFs, but each
                                    of those is lacking broader vision. I&#39;m the one keeping track of the big
                                    picture here, and if I happen to mention that Equius going out with a
                                    bigger bang would have been kind of dumb, like so many other things on
                                    people&#39;s wish lists, I guess you just gotta trust me!

                                    CALLED IT!s chiming in for backup, oh and also some HELL YEAH VAMPNAYA
                                    TIME!s working their way in there. This is not to say the outcome was a
                                    lock, because there is always the possibility for red herrings, and
                                    enough of those have been established so that you can never feel
                                    completely safe with a prediction. That is their primary value.
                                    Seriously, it isn&#39;t just messing with people. Making a story
                                    unpredictable has a lot to do with showing you are capable of doing
                                    practically anything at any time. Sometimes you bluff, and sometimes you
                                    play it straight. It&#39;s a little like a poker game. If you do too much
                                    of one or the other, people can read you easily. Even the silly self
                                    insert stuff has benefits in this regard. Predicting what&#39;s to come in
                                    the story is no different from putting yourself in the head of the
                                    author. If the author paints a portrait of himself as kind of a loose
                                    canon, either through a volatile narrative, or in an absurdly literal
                                    way as I do with the AH nonsense, that will be the consequence. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Part of the fun of a story is its unpredictability, and this one has had
                                    plenty of it so far I think. Unpredictability is a significant basis
                                    for suspense, and I&#39;m sure has other benefits we could examine. But I
                                    think there is also enjoyment value in occasional predictability, or
                                    rather, guessability. Setting up some obvious clues, and running with
                                    them to their logical conclusion. It&#39;s like throwing the reader a bone,
                                    particularly those who may be prone to feeling a little overwhelmed by
                                    getting perpetually outfoxed by the narrative. Another example of that
                                    was Jade&#39;s penpal letter. I designed it so that the clues would scream
                                    GRANDPA GRANDPA GRANDPA, and of course that&#39;s what most people were
                                    guessing. And the guess was very much on the right track. But that
                                    doesn&#39;t mean it was safe from another twist. It was her grandson, which
                                    is an outcome still compatible with the original clues, in a way. And
                                    while managing to be surprising, and not particularly guessable. So in
                                    that sense I guess that development had the best of both worlds. Letting
                                    people pick up on some more obvious clues for a change, and still
                                    delivering a surprise.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    How guessable something is also relates to how close to the event you
                                    get. Prior to Eridan&#39;s entrance into the room, and even during, the
                                    deaths were completely unguessable. After Feferi&#39;s death, Kanaya&#39;s
                                    becomes considerably more so, but still quite uncertain. After her
                                    death, all bets are off. Not only do all deaths thereafter become
                                    guessable, but in some cases, &quot;predictable&quot;. That&#39;s because it was the
                                    line between a series of shocking events, and the establishment of an
                                    actual story pattern. The new pattern serves a purpose, as a sort of
                                    announcement that the story is shifting gears, that we&#39;re drifting into
                                    these mock-survival horror, mock-crime drama segments, driven by
                                    suspense more than usual. The suspense has more authority because of all
                                    the collateral of unpredictability built up over time, as well as all
                                    the typical stuff that helps like long term characterization. But now
                                    that the pattern is out in the open, following through with more deaths
                                    no longer qualifies as unpredictability. Just the opposite, it would now
                                    be playing into expectations, which as I said, can be important too.
                                    This gear we&#39;ve switched to is the new normal, and any unpredictability
                                    to arise thereafter will necessarily be a departure from whatever
                                    current patterns would indicate.

                                    The fellows in Jailbreak even had a goddang harpoon gun, just like Jade.
                                    But... I didn&#39;t get to work that in. Not every idea I have gets worked
                                    in, if you can believe it.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    And one final note, this whole thing neatly solved the problem of
                                    building up Jade&#39;s house. I had long wondered how I might handle that,
                                    with it&#39;s unusual design. I concluded the best way was to knock off the
                                    tower/ball part, and build up the blockier structure.

                                    Some people regard the zodiac realignment as having stunning implications for the HS

                                    <br>
                                    The 13th sign has always existed in more obscure interpretations of
                                    astrology, and I have always known about it. The diehard HS theorists
                                    have been wise to its existence since the trolls were first connected to
                                    the zodiac.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    This means the 13th sign has always had the potential to emerge in the
                                    story in some way. It either will or it won&#39;t. That hasn&#39;t changed at

                                    This scene was essential. It brought closure to Rufio&#39;s arc, who
                                    was clearly the third most important character in Homestuck. He died a

                                    I am probably conveying the impression that I am planning on
                                    resorting to it much more frequently in the future than I really am.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Some people love it, and some people hate it. I wonder what conclusion I should draw
                                    from this schism in reception?<br>
                                    <br>
                                    How about:<br>

                                    pf?f?f?f?f?f?f?f<br>

                                    I view them as little opportunities to do funny things, sometimes
                                    serving as transitions both in mood and story direction, and yet another
                                    device with which to keep things light and ridiculous in a story which I
                                    refuse to drag all the way on to serious turf, even if I threaten to at
                                    times.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    You could view me as a sort of &quot;host&quot; of the story, touching on recent
                                    themes in silly ways. Sometimes story&#39;s have such players - in the
                                    story, but not actually a part of it. If I were to influence the story
                                    events directly, that would be a different type of self insert approach,
                                    and one I have no interest in. If I have any impact on the story at
                                    all, it will be through an explicitly unobtrusive mechanism. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I have no problem saying so, because that&#39;s not actually a point of suspense I care
                                    about.

                                    No way. That movie didn&#39;t invent time travel complexity nor is
                                    it really close to being the most compelling implementation of those
                                    concepts. It was a pretty decent movie, but the only thing it actually
                                    influenced were those time trails in the Felt arc.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Complex time travel stuff is something I&#39;ve always thought about.
                                    Actually, about ten years ago around the time when that movie came out,
                                    my friend Jan and I (who I did the Star Trek edits with) worked for a
                                    while on a screenplay for what we were slating to be the most maniacal
                                    and complicated time travel movie ever. It was called Copy/Paste. We
                                    were essentially working on Primer I guess, a few years before Primer
                                    came out. It was pretty close to being done, but I guess we lost
                                    interest. Then later Primer came out, and we didn&#39;t need to bother with
                                    that anymore. Then 5 years after that I started Homestuck, thus
                                    rendering Primer obsolete, in a flourish of silly jokes. (????) (YOU
                                    DECIDE.)

                                    I&#39;m not even sure I do compared to a lot of other well known internet creators, but
                                    it doesn&#39;t matter. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Feelings-wise, I&#39;m pretty much unflappable. You might as well register
                                    your grievance with a brick wall. And in some cases, negative opinions
                                    only fuel in-story &quot;rebukes&quot;, but that has more to do with mischief on
                                    my part than actual retaliation. And I am prone to finding that funny,
                                    whereas OBVIOUSLY the critic will not, and will be inclined to register
                                    additional meaningless grievances. It&#39;s all good.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    A statement that I think encapsulates my attitude is, all things being
                                    equal, which they aren&#39;t, why is this guy&#39;s opinion better than mine? <br>
                                    <br>
                                    First of all, the situation is very, very far from being equal. I don&#39;t
                                    think much hubris is required to believe that ME vs. RANDOM INTERNET GUY
                                    is not close to a fair fight.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Second, even if the metrics tracking quality thought broke even between
                                    us, it is merely opinion vs. opinion. I&#39;ll side with mine, thanks.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Opinions aren&#39;t even real things. They are ghosts made of thought. But
                                    lots of people on the internet, especially grumpy ones, treat theirs as
                                    absolute reality. Which can be pretty funny to watch. Or terrible. Re:
                                    youtube comments.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    If you&#39;re a creative type who struggles with how others receive your
                                    work, I might suggest embracing the attitude above. But before you go
                                    too far with it, you also might want to try real hard to be good at
                                    something first.

                                    It is extremely hilarious to me, especially when put in the light of his

                                    goofy fan stuff made about him, and knowing about the turn months ago
                                    while people had no clue, and the reasons go on.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I just think a wide range of stuff is funny. If you say I lump too much
                                    under humor, it really only means we don&#39;t share the same sense of

                                    I think it can be pretty interesting how a single line in a
                                    story, even one that&#39;s seven words, can dramatically alter the the
                                    perception of everything that just happened.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    In this case, I think presented on the heels of the deaths, it created a
                                    weird blend of sudden fear, as well as a contradictory emotion of hope,
                                    that MAYBE we haven&#39;t seen the last of one of these characters, even if
                                    the implications are ominous.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    There have been a couple others sprinkled about HS. I think tvtropes
                                    calls them WHAM LINES or KAPOW STATEMENTS or whatever. (i am not even
                                    busting on the tropes here, that&#39;s a pretty legit thing to diagnose)<br>
                                    <br>
                                    But really, I mainly like that page because of the text highlighting
                                    slow-roll. It was a fun preexisting mechanism to employ for suspense.

                                    one I anticipated a long time ago when considering the possibility of a

                                    later, and didn&#39;t really cut their teeth on the &quot;MSPA culture&quot; from

                                    On the other hand, I know many of those people have been savvy enough to
                                    pick up on it, read earlier stories, do a little homework, and start to
                                    figure out why everything is the way it is.

                                    Kind Of Thing. Sometimes a sad moment is played totally straight (like
                                    Jade&#39;s letter to John). Sometimes, or often, a sad or violent moment
                                    will be accented with humor, if not played humorously straightup. <br>

                                    time. Regardless, there was some groundwork set up for that possibility
                                    should I decide to run with it, which I did, and the decision was made
                                    quite some time ago.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Same with others we&#39;ve seen recently. Kanaya had the theme of virginity
                                    due to her sign, which when you think about it, is a pretty TOUGH
                                    CONCEPT to shape into coherence for a character in an ensemble like
                                    this, but I worked it by bonding her to matriarchal themes with her
                                    virgin mother grub lusus, and the role she inherited as progenitor and
                                    caretaker of the matriorb, and more specifically, recently showing the
                                    futility of that role, as the concept of chastity is not particularly
                                    compatible with successful breeding. When she found the key to release
                                    it, it was a sign that all along it was not meant to be used, but
                                    destroyed.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Eridan was originally cast as someone dangerous and genocidal, but those
                                    qualities were never illustrated and became easily dismissed as a joke
                                    as his whole character seemed to revolve around failed romantic
                                    aspirations for so long. But they came back, reminding us they were
                                    driving forces behind his profile. (His name, caligulasAquarium, was
                                    also tied to his various romantic obsessions, particularly the need for a
                                    rival, which is bound to the caliginous quadrant, another word for
                                    dark.) Ultimately his dreams of genocide were realized by being the one
                                    to destroy the orb, which appeared to always be his intent for &quot;helping
                                    her&quot; with it, making his preceding conversation with Kanaya much more
                                    detestably villainous than it seemed. In doing so, he destroyed hope for
                                    the species. This is his final interpretation of his role as the Prince
                                    of Hope. Not as one who fights for hope, but destroys it. He&#39;s
                                    certainly the worst kind of bastard this story has to offer.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Both Eridan&#39;s and Gamzee&#39;s dangerous sides were heavily masked by the
                                    long adherence to their roles as one note gag characters, and made it
                                    very difficult to predict these outcomes seriously. A few days ago,
                                    nobody at all is guessing Eridan walks into a room and kills two
                                    characters. And before this page:<br>
                                    <br>
                                    <a class="nofollow" href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=005119" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=005119</a><br>
                                    <br>
                                    Even fewer people would ever make a serious guess Gamzee would become a threat.
                                    Commitment to the gag was too air tight.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    But that&#39;s was makes the development equal parts disturbing and funny in my view.

                                    I&#39;m not going to pretend I didn&#39;t think it was a very sad event.
                                    Feferi was one thing, as a pretty tangential character. But Kanaya was
                                    the one that hurt.<br>

                                    Sad things happen in stories. Even funny ones!<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Probably the most memorable episode of Futurama for me was the one where
                                    his dog waits for him on the street corner for years, until it dies.
                                    And then? THE END.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    That was awful! I don&#39;t know anyone who ever watched that episode who
                                    wasn&#39;t emotionally crushed by that ending. Almost to the point where it
                                    was unbelievable they made such a thing happen. I was not alone in
                                    speaking to the TV: &quot;Futurama, what are you doing to me? FUTURAMA???
                                    You&#39;re not supposed to do this, you&#39;re FUNNY!!!&quot;<br>
                                    <br>
                                    And yet, that episode was great! Even the ending was great, all things
                                    considered. In retrospect its very gesture was sort of darkly hilarious.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I&#39;m not exactly comparing this character death with that moment, but
                                    just pointing it out as an example of a piece of entertainment which I
                                    believe successfully blended emotional tones. That&#39;s what&#39;s been going
                                    on with HS for quite some time.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    In fact, Futurama always struck me as a really good example of something
                                    that did that, and I can think of very few other examples. Futurama was
                                    perpetually hilarious, while doing a pretty great job of making you
                                    care about the characters and what happened to them. It actually
                                    successfully pulled off a lot of poignant moments, not just dog
                                    killings. I&#39;m trying to think of of other comparably humorous pieces of
                                    entertainment that worked a serious side well and not thinking of much.
                                    The Simpsons, not quite. Certainly nothing of Family Guy&#39;s ilk. (ok I&#39;m
                                    really just thinking of TV shows now) Arrested Development could be a
                                    good example. Certainly off the charts in hilarity and characterization,
                                    though in hindsight I don&#39;t think it ever laid the drama on all that
                                    thick. It usually played its serious notes to set up gags, and often
                                    shortchanged drama by making continuity itself a gag (NEXT TIME ON
                                    ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT: jokes jokes jokes)<br>
                                    <br>
                                    If I had to grope for another example, I might reach back years and
                                    years to something called Red Dwarf. Which was a British scifi comedy tv
                                    show. But not the show, the book! The novelization of it was my first
                                    exposure to it, and when I was a teenager I remember thinking it was the
                                    funniest, greatest shit ever. It might have been my teen goggles
                                    tinting it though, I really don&#39;t know how it would hold up for me now. I
                                    didn&#39;t even know it was based on a show, and later when I saw it, I
                                    thought it was good, but not as great unsurprisingly. Oddly, the concept
                                    was essentially the same as Futurama. A guy is frozen in stasis for a
                                    long time, wakes up in the future. But he&#39;s the last guy alive, a la
                                    Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide. I always liked this way better than Hitchhiker&#39;s
                                    though for some reason, which I was never as gaga over as so many seem
                                    to be. This story struck me as not only funnier, but more heartfelt, and
                                    really captured the essence of the lonely journey of the last human
                                    alive, alone in a giant space ship with his idiot hologram friend.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Thinking back on it, I&#39;m probably weirdly influenced by that series in ways I&#39;m
                                    probably not even aware of.<br>

                                    People tend to be pretty emotional creatures and I know that
                                    some people shed tears over much lesser turns in a story than this.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    So knowing that, I guess there is something a little weird about pulling
                                    the trigger on an event which I know perfectly well will cause plenty
                                    of people to cry ACTUAL TEARS, most of which are probably perfectly nice
                                    teenage girls who I have no business affecting in this way at all. To
                                    those people I guess I&#39;ll have to offer a real apology, because I&#39;m not
                                    actually out to ruin anyone&#39;s day.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    But when you&#39;re making a story with any sort of dramatic clout, even a
                                    largely humorous one, I don&#39;t think it pays to be gutless. Both in terms
                                    of reader reaction, fear of sparking sadness, anger, or bad reviews,
                                    and in terms of being overly precious with your characters and ideas, to
                                    the point where it becomes obvious you&#39;re unwilling to mess with
                                    anything or put anyone important in real danger, which does a lot to
                                    kill suspense. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    But that&#39;s actually a pretty common way to construct a story, to the
                                    point where we are all extremely used to watching stuff where heroes
                                    are in no real peril, and because it&#39;s so common we can accept and enjoy
                                    it. This also makes it more shocking and emotional when a story steps
                                    outside of that comfort zone.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    But it&#39;s only emotional if people are invested in those threatened. This
                                    is one reason why a lot of horror movies can be so ineffective, grisly
                                    moments notwithstanding. Rosters are knowingly introduced for the
                                    slaughter, with only lip service given to investment in characters. And
                                    even if approached skillfully, there isn&#39;t even much time to win the
                                    hearts and minds of the audience for the full cast.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    But this is a little different. We&#39;ve spent a lot of time with these
                                    characters. And if the threat to their lives seems like a sudden
                                    direction, I&#39;d suggest that doing it earlier or more gradually wouldn&#39;t
                                    have allowed it to mean the same thing.

                                    The longer I do this the more I&#39;m struck by how radical the
                                    difference is between the experiences of reading something archivally
                                    vs. serially, both for the reader, and the author if he&#39;s prone to
                                    sampling reactions frequently as I do. For the reader especially, I
                                    think the experience of day to day reading is so dramatically different,
                                    they might as well be reading a different story altogether. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The main difference is the amount of space between events the reader
                                    has, which can be filled with massive amounts of speculation, analysis,
                                    predictions, and something I guess you could call &quot;opinion building&quot;,
                                    which can have both positive and negative effects. On the positive side,
                                    these readers become more closely engaged with the material than
                                    archival readers can be, zeroing in on details and insights which might
                                    be overlooked otherwise. On the negative side, I think that excess
                                    mental noise the space between pages allows can potentially be a bit
                                    suffocating, and put a strain on the experience the material was
                                    intended to deliver.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The archival reader always has the luxury of moving on to the next page,
                                    regardless of how he reacts to certain events, and thus can be more
                                    impassive about it. That internal cacophony isn&#39;t given time to build,
                                    and if there are reservations about a string of events, whether due to
                                    shocking revelations, or questions over the narrative merit of
                                    something, or really any form of dissatisfaction, all he has to do is
                                    keep clicking to see how it all fits together, and can make a more
                                    complete judgment with hindsight.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The recent pages had me particularly conscious of the nature of serial
                                    delivery. The whole scene was rolled out over the course of a weekend,
                                    first with Feferi, then Kanaya. When Fereri dies, this registers as one
                                    extremely dramatic event. Cue the waiting, speculating, worrying and all
                                    that. When Kanaya dies a day or so later, it registers as a second
                                    dramatic event! Again the scrutiny begins which the space allows. Is
                                    this all too much? How do I feel about this narrative turn? Is this
                                    setting a trend for a bloodbath? Does that serve any purpose? The reader
                                    projects into the future, does a little unwitting fanfiction writing in
                                    his head, and may not like what he sees! All this activity becomes the
                                    basis for opinion building, which is sort of the emergence of an
                                    official position on matters, good or bad, which is only able to
                                    flourish in the slow-motion intake of the story. That official position
                                    can be a very stubborn thing, especially when it&#39;s negative, and
                                    seriously textures the way additional developments are regarded. It&#39;s
                                    really hard to shake a reader off an entrenched position on a matter,
                                    even when it was formed with an incomplete picture.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Reading the same events in the archive is quite different. Very little
                                    of that inner monologue takes shape. And while the events are still
                                    shocking, and the reader may raise his eyebrows a mile high, he then
                                    simply lowers them and keeps reading. In fact, because of the reading
                                    pace, I would suggest these two deaths actually register as only ONE
                                    DRAMATIC EVENT! One guy snaps and kills two characters. In the flow of
                                    straight-through reading especially, it is quite startling,
                                    tension-building, and can only serve to propel the reader into further
                                    pages, at a pace which suspends the experience-compromising
                                    (augmenting??) play-by-play.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    But like I&#39;ve said, I don&#39;t think one way of reading is necessarily
                                    better than the other. Both have plusses, and obviously I choose to make
                                    this serially, and I play off plenty of in the moment reactions. But I
                                    tend consider the archival experience more, because when all is said and
                                    done, this thing has to sit on a server for years to come, waiting for
                                    new people to find it.

                                    This Flash page is an appropriate length for the purpose it served. The
                                    first Flash game involving the trolls was inordinately long, taking
                                    something like 30 minutes for a player to feel sure all possibilities
                                    have been exhausted. But its length provided a good way to demonstrate
                                    the format&#39;s capabilities.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    It set a precedent for a game of that length, but not a trend. There&#39;s
                                    no reason to expect they should all be. These are just individual pages
                                    in a story after all, and my intent for the format was always to make
                                    the games about this length.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The battle at the end did mark the end of the game. There was nothing
                                    more to it, and I don&#39;t think it needed to be especially explicit about
                                    that. You could try mashing the spacebar during the battle or whatever,
                                    and observe it did nothing. The prompt at the end to restart tells you
                                    it&#39;s over. What else is there to suggest there&#39;s more? Aside from an
                                    expectation that since it feels like a fully functional game, it should
                                    behave like one rather than what is essentially a shallow simulation to
                                    hit a few story points.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    But that&#39;s one of the pitfalls of mixing these types of media. While
                                    flipping through pages, you switch from your &quot;story reader&#39;s mind&quot; to
                                    your &quot;game player&#39;s mind&quot;, which expects different things. Having played
                                    many games, we grow to expect fully fleshed out, complete gaming
                                    experiences from whatever we play, even if not consciously. These little
                                    in-story fragments can leave us a little puzzled, because they are
                                    incomplete, and the instinctive game player in us finds that a little
                                    frustrating. But I view this as a good thing, and wouldn&#39;t seek to
                                    improve it. The clash between those two mindsets of media consumption
                                    demonstrates we&#39;re engaging with something unique. It&#39;s not an
                                    experience you have with other forms of entertainment.

                                    There are actually clues about Jade&#39;s awakening in her
                                    conversation with Tavros, in retrospect. If you read between the lines,
                                    and draw from what we now know about Kanaya, you can make a decent guess
                                    about what happened.<br>
                                    <br>

                                    <br>
                                    She said:<br>
                                    <br>
                                    GG: when i was REALLY young, i was sure the doll sitting across from him did it<br>
                                    GG: and for a long time i was terrified of the evil blue girl!!!<br>
                                    GG: she sort of haunted my childhood and i had trouble sleeping for a long time <br>
                                    <br>
                                    She complains about insomnia while young, just like Kanaya did. When
                                    Kanaya was put to sleep by Scratch, her insomnia ended, and she woke up.
                                    We also know Jade did not have trouble sleeping for very long. Vriska
                                    started putting her to sleep to test out her powers.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Match this up with some remarks by Kanaya:<br>
                                    <br>

                                    <br>
                                    So it would seem Jade and Kanaya have another thing in common.

                                    The conflict between the kingdoms is regimented. There are
                                    rules, like in chess, though much more complex. It isn&#39;t necessarily all
                                    out war, except for what takes place on advanced stages of the
                                    battlefield. If the queen is in power, she leaves them alone. Killing
                                    them would be improper. If Jack is in power, he clearly has no problem
                                    with it. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    And there&#39;s potentially more to it than some kind of etiquette. Though
                                    the Derse dreamers are heroes, they still serve as emissaries to the
                                    dark gods, who presumably tend to be opposed to the goal of creation,
                                    like Derse. There always remains the possibility that the Derse dreamers
                                    will carry out the agenda of the gods without understanding what
                                    they&#39;re doing. To kill those kids before that would lack strategic
                                    foresight, something a queen has.

                                        Jade simply look at the same frozen frog in the past, and attempt to
                                        appearify it? This would create a paradox, as the frog would never be

                                    I don&#39;t think it was a direct inspiration, but I&#39;m sure it crossed my mind at the
                                    time.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    This is probably how most kinds of inspiration work. I hardly ever come
                                    up with an idea directly inspired something else (unless it&#39;s something I
                                    did, in which case I do it almost constantly.) But then after I have
                                    the idea, I may immediately think of something that&#39;s kind of similar
                                    from another work. I may then modify the idea to make it more
                                    reminiscent of that thing, if I feel like solidifying that particular
                                    reference. The Donnie Darko style past/future trails in the intermission
                                    might be a good example of that. Or, I may attempt to stifle
                                    similarities if the reference doesn&#39;t interest me.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The chocobo breeding thing always struck me as a really solid example of
                                    a side quest in a game. Pretty tedious, definitely optional, yet
                                    leading to major boons far beyond the normal scope of the game.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    So in that sense, frog breeding was always supposed to be reminiscent of
                                    a fun side quest. And yet, it&#39;s still absolutely essential to
                                    completing the game&#39;s objective. So it&#39;s not technically a side quest at
                                    all. Only in spirit.

                                    This question would exist plentifully regardless of what animal
                                    was selected. Knowing this, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a very interesting avenue
                                    of discussion right now. Are we to weigh the universe containment
                                    merits of frogs, vs. say, bears?<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The definitive answer, as of now, is that any definitive answer would be pretty
                                    boring.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    But there are nevertheless some reasons. And more important than the
                                    reasons for the decision is to notice how thematically entrenched frogs
                                    have been in the story for a very long time. All the mechanics of this,
                                    the genesis frog and the frog breeding stuff, was conceptualized well
                                    before the end of act 2. EOA2 was when we first saw the frog ruins,
                                    remember? An idol of the embodiment of a universe to be created,
                                    positioned where Skaia would be, surrounded by four towers representing
                                    the planets. There was no basis for speculation on why a frog stood in
                                    Skaia&#39;s place until now. This has probably been the slowest boiling
                                    mystery in the entire story. After a while, I think prolonged,
                                    relentless exposure to certain symbols and aspects of a myth start to
                                    wear down the need to justify why they exist. They exist simply because
                                    they exist, like the features of fables we&#39;ve all heard a thousand
                                    times. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    And finally, in processing the &quot;why frogs&quot; matter, it does help to
                                    understand the mentality I have in coming up with all ideas for HS. The
                                    idea from the start was to come up with a very elaborate, fantastical
                                    and ridiculous creation myth. Some ideas are quite esoteric, some are
                                    quite passable for more conventional works of science fiction, and some
                                    are very silly. Most are a combination of these. Most of the time, the
                                    silly stuff is not so outrageously silly that it can&#39;t be workable in a
                                    serious way too when needed. That adequately describes the concept of a
                                    universe existing inside of a large frog bred and genetically engineered
                                    by children, I think.

                                        really like the idea! It&#39;s like a reference to the Tower of Babel and
                                        it kind of makes sense given the context of Skaia as the place where
                                        godhood is reached</a>

                                    The Tower of Babel did come to mind. There are many symbolic
                                    aspects you could find in it, many relating to ascension. It also put to
                                    use the basic idea of house building, inspired by Sim games, by tying
                                    it to a more obvious goal, to reach the gates, and then reach Skaia.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Obviously it&#39;s pretty easy for players to &quot;cheat&quot; and invent means of
                                    flying to skip the arduous climb, but as with many things, there are
                                    still hidden reasons for why the building is necessary which haven&#39;t
                                    been revealed. And if nothing else, it does convey the way the game is
                                    &quot;supposed&quot; to be played under ordinary circumstances, with kids making
                                    these insane vertical journeys through their houses, followed by
                                    fantastical horizontal journeys through their lands. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Also note that there are many, many ways in which the concepts if
                                    Homestuck were influenced by Problem Sleuth. The Cathedral of Syndetic
                                    Ascension was two huge towers meeting in the middle of the universe.
                                    Climbing the towers was a significant quest for the four heroes in PS.
                                    The consorts were always meant to parallel the silly members of the four
                                    kingdoms. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Another detail of interest: note that there was a volcano next to the cathedral
                                    which played a significant role in the story.

                                        Then how come Viriska&#39;s and Aradia&#39;s outfits look almost the same? and

                                    Metamorphosis is clearly a significant part of troll biology, and
                                    therefore ingrained in their mythology. They&#39;ve got cocoons everywhere,
                                    and are often likened to insects through biological terms. The wings
                                    have nothing (we know of) to do with troll adulthood. But have a lot to
                                    do with their perception of what ascension should be, which is the
                                    culmination of a pupation process. Which is why some may look to fairies
                                    as an ideal, or rule them out as fiction on account of the ideal they
                                    represent. Ascended trolls in this game are essentially magical fairies.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Humans do not have a good analog for this though, and enjoy no biological upgrades.

                                    He and Vriska took a moment to make a couple of useless replies to a

                                    She did have an extra life. She had a dream self all along. It
                                    just wasn&#39;t in a tower. It was sleeping in a crypt in the center of
                                    Derse, which essentially functioned as her Quest Cocoon.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    She is a special case with respect to having a dream self (like Sollux
                                    was, who had two), and also with respect to the god tier resurrection.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The same rules couldn&#39;t apply to her, since she&#39;s the only character
                                    who&#39;s been dead since long before beginning the game. She couldn&#39;t
                                    resurrect the usual way because she was already dead.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    So she has a different set of rules to suit her unique circumstances. We
                                    were lead to believe she didn&#39;t have a dream self, because she was
                                    dead, and because she didn&#39;t have a tower. But she was in the crypt the
                                    whole time, on her sacrificial platform, looking pretty corpse-like. Was
                                    her dream self dead too? There&#39;s no need for a definitive answer. But
                                    it would be reasonable to view her slumber as a state of undead-like
                                    stasis, like a vampire in a crypt.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Her resurrection demanded that her dream self be killed on the platform.
                                    And so it waited there for the entire session until Jack destroyed
                                    Derse, and was consumed by fire. This woke her up, and restored her to
                                    life for the first time in years. Her robot exploded as her soul
                                    un-disembodied itself. She then attained the god tier as the Maid of
                                    Time.

                                    collapsed under the weight of 1200+ unnavigable, unsearchable questions,
                                    most of which were silly and wildly &quot;off topic&quot;. (re: there was no

                                    <br>
                                    I have saved all of those questions and will comb through them at some
                                    point to select the most interesting ones and display them elsewhere, in
                                    a manner that is easy to browse, an arrangement they did not enjoy in
                                    Formspring&#39;s ponderous and entirely nonexistent archival system.<br>

                                    I will also try to keep things more OT with this account, and address
                                    stuff that people presumably give a shit about, and try to keep the
                                    nonsensical haggling to a minimum, as well as avoid bringing to light
                                    questions of no substance. All of that was done with a spirit of
                                    amusement, though some people surely disagreed with its humorous merit.
                                    They were probably right! What do I know.<br>

                                    You may now ask me a question. This account is like a new Chia Pet fresh
                                    out of the box, and you have the privilege of applying the disgusting
                                    coat of mud to the orange ceramic surface, getting grossed out, and
                                    regarding your purchase with a deep sense of remorse. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    You may also liken the account to a new kit of Sea Monkeys you just purchased for
                                    some baffling reason. That&#39;s fine too.
