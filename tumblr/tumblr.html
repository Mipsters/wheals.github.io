            <div class="title">LE factoids</div>
            <div class="copy">
                <p>Later I might open the tumblr question box dealie for like ten minutes, let about a thousand silly
                    questions flood in, then shut it off and answer a few. But for now I might as well address a few
                    points of curiosity preemptively on the latest animation, and LE in general.</p>
                <p>Everything here&#8217;s based on some general line of inquiry I&#8217;ve seen posted elsewhere more
                    than once.</p>
                <p><!-- more --><strong>Where is this happening? Where is Scratch&#8217;s wrecked apartment
                    floating?</strong> It&#8217;s free-floating debris from the two universes destroyed, which now
                    comprise the green sun. That floating hunk of building is suspended, and temporarily preserved in,
                    let&#8217;s call it a small pocket of green-hot spacetime soup inside the sun. Chronologically, this
                    little pocket of space is very near the final dying moment of the troll universe, where LE makes his
                    entrance. He then goes back in time to fuck shit up throughout the history of that universe, as has
                    been described many times. That is why he was always &#8220;already there.&#8221; It is also
                    because, as it turns out, he was lurking dormant in Scratch&#8217;s puppet-host body the whole time.
                    Doc always did claim to be excellent host.</p>
                <p><strong>Is Scratch literally Lord English? Or has LE completely replaced him? How much of Scratch&#8217;s
                    cognizance/personality/being is still in LE?</strong> Well, here&#8217;s what the story told us.
                    Scratch said he had to die for LE to be brought into this universe. Now we have seen why explicitly.
                    Scratch doesn&#8217;t lie, when it comes to simple statements of fact. He only excludes details and
                    clarification. So, he is now dead. LE has officially replaced him, albeit traveled back in time to
                    coexist with him, presumably continuing to utilize him as an employee, in all the ways we know
                    about, and maybe others we don&#8217;t. They&#8217;re separate entities. Though because they share
                    the same body more or less, and essentially the same origin, they share properties. Both have the
                    powers of a first guardian (though Scratch said outright LE was more powerful than him). Both have
                    &#8220;Cal genes,&#8221; whatever the hell that means. In LE&#8217;s case, the resemblance is
                    obvious. They share an interest in the ladies (Scratch takes a shining to younger ones while LE
                    ropes more mature females into service. Reasoning? Scratch is a young LE!) They appear to have
                    opposite demeanors though. Scratch is calm, calculating, manipulative. English is brutal, angry, and
                    out to wreak havoc on a universe without any particular desire for subtlety. Their appearances
                    reflect the differences. Is LE omniscient like Scratch? There&#8217;s evidence that he&#8217;s a
                    strong tactician and adept with time travel, but its unclear whether he maintains the omniscience
                    post-transformation. Consider that Scratch&#8217;s omniscience was closely tied to the other half of
                    his genetic makeup, a magic cueball which had all the answers to everything concealed within. When
                    LE transformed, he kept all the Cal properties (magnified them actually), but dropped the cueball
                    aspect. In fact, his cueball head exploded outright. This was &#8220;the break&#8221; Scratch
                    referred to once or twice. A literal description of LE&#8217;s emergence, as well as reference to
                    the pool term, where the cueball scatters all the other balls, and the game begins.</p>
                <p><strong><a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=005500">T1CK</a> <a

                    HONK</a></strong>. This is not a question, but some notes anyway. This string of genetic code
                    letters is probably the most clear and present foreshadowing of LE&#8217;s transformation. It is
                    practically a brief sentence describing the process, in order, culminating in LE&#8217;s vast honk.
                    I think this one clue got some people speculating, correctly, that LE would emerge in some way from
                    Scratch, involving his head breaking open. Probably a minority theory, but it was out there, because
                    the clues were there. Revelations in a story are shocking in proportion to how little groundwork was
                    laid for that development, and how obscured the clues were, if they even existed at all. It would
                    have been more startling if LE turned out to be some ridiculous preexisting character, like
                    Maplehoof or Charles Dutton or whatever, but the shock value would come with no credible basis in
                    the narrative. So big reveals like this always come with sort of a balancing act of establishing
                    clues to make the event credible and premeditated, while obscuring/misdirecting so as not to totally
                    blow it. No matter how well you disguise it, if the clues are there, some will guess it. Personally,
                    I feel like the shock value is not so much stored in the fact that Scratch = LE, but in the sudden,
                    disturbing nature and presentation of the transformation itself. And hey, if the Scratch = LE tidbit
                    happened to catch you way off guard, I&#8217;ll consider it a bonus.</p>
                <p><strong>Why&#8217;s LE honking like Gamzee???</strong> If you&#8217;re prepared to be very literal,
                    you might believe LE&#8217;s honking is a symptom of Gamzee&#8217;s influence in some way, due to
                    time shenanigans or what have you. Examined logically, it&#8217;s the other way around. On LE&#8217;s
                    arrival, he releases the vast honk Gamzee&#8217;s religion foretold. LE has always been around
                    influencing troll culture from the start, and it seems he was always the embodiment of the mirthful
                    messiahs the highbloods worshiped, since he was really two beings, Doc Scratch and LE, both &#8220;mirthful&#8221;
                    puppet-based entities, in their own ways. Gamzee&#8217;s honking, the humorous brutality of the
                    subjugglators and their dark spiritual beliefs, all could be traced to LE. The vast honk clip was
                    actually a heavily modified sound clip of a bike horn, like one of Gamzee&#8217;s, slowed way down.
                    First a small honk from the squeeze, then a big one from the unsqueeze. Sounds a lot like the noise
                    the tripods made in War of the Worlds, which has me convinced those were made from slowed down bike
                    horns too.</p>
                <p><strong>What&#8217;s with the sarcophagus?</strong> That is actually the alternate form of the <a
                        href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003153">Cairo Overcoat</a>,
                    which doubles as his notorious oversized garment, and his chariot in which he travels through time,
                    not terribly unlike Dr. Who&#8217;s TARDIS. The name and functionality was spawned completely from
                    the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=4&amp;p=001057">Chicago
                        Overcoat</a>, which was the name of Mobster Kingpin&#8217;s flying pirate ship/office. Chicago
                    Overcoat is also mobster slang for a coffin, therefore a Cairo Overcoat must refer to a Sarcophagus.
                    (Which also happens to have a Terminator skull over the Pharaoh&#8217;s face.) LE&#8217;s ties to
                    Egyptian lore in part trace back to a reference, through his attire obviously, to Joseph and the
                    Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, a significant part of which takes place in Egypt. Also, more vaguely,
                    the coat struck me as something that might be worn by one or more iterations of Dr. Who. And lest we
                    forget the most obvious quality of its appearance, something that could easily adorn a pimp. As with
                    many things in HS, there&#8217;s quite a slurry of references coming together to form something
                    basically ridiculous, and yet dead fucking serious. LE is many things. A time traveling crime lord
                    pimp. An omnipotent, indestructible puppet-based demon. A monster born out of an ancient, short,
                    smug, cueball-headed gunslinger, the blight of two universes by his birth alone. An Egyptian pharaoh
                    Incredible Hulk in shredded pants and suspenders with a green <a
                            href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002470">Jigsaw
                        puppet</a>-like skull for head, a gold fang, and flashing pool balls for eyes. And with his gold
                    cuestick pegleg and long coat, appears to also be somewhat reminiscent of a pirate, and may or may
                    not bear some tenuous connection to Skipper Plumbthroat, nemesis of all Squiddles, who have been
                    clearly shown to be friendly cartoon-standins for the dark gods.</p>
                <p><strong>So LE is the Hulk in suspenders with a Cal skull for a head&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;
                    really????</strong> Yes, really. I think his appearance is not what most were expecting, nor what
                    some desired, but this is a consequence of hype factor alone. It&#8217;s inevitable, keeping a
                    mystery such as this dangling out there for almost two years. People start to get attached to what
                    they envision. There is no creative advantage at all to hype. When hype is significant, you can only
                    hope to meet it at best, or more likely fall short. I felt pretty fortunate that by and large the
                    hype surrounding EOA5 was met for most people. I&#8217;m doubtful it was surpassed for many, by
                    much, considering the two month pause caused people to guess SOMETHING big was coming. Now imagine
                    instead of a two month delay, there was none at all! Bam, 13 minute animation out of nowhere. The
                    difference in reader perception in such a case is so extreme, it can&#8217;t even be communicated.
                    Conclusion: hype sux.</p>
                <p>This is exactly how I pictured LE looking before I even made the Felt intermission. I think if I
                    revealed him then, practically everyone would say, yeah that&#8217;s about right. Just a nasty,
                    monstrous looking mob boss with some gaudy accoutrements. In time, as the mystique surrounding him
                    accumulates, people get other ideas. I think some wanted a more suave motherfucker to bust onto the
                    scene, someone perhaps sleek, dapper. This doesn&#8217;t fit the concept at all, nor suits anything
                    we knew about him previously. Doc Scratch is his smooth, well mannered counterpart. He already fills
                    that role. LE as Scratch 2 is a really boring idea to me. LE as a big, no-nonsense brute,
                    functioning as Mr. Hyde to Scratch&#8217;s Dr. Jekyll, is much more interesting. (Hey, there&#8217;s
                    another bullet point for the reference slurry, if you&#8217;re taking notes, re: Jekyll/Hyde.) So
                    instead of some elegant dude too dashing for words who exploded from the screen of the yaoiest anime
                    you ever saw, he looks a bit like <a

            <div class="copy"><p>All of western Mass. lost power the other night because of some sort of absurd spooky
                pre-Halloween snowstorm. Yesterday morning I figured it&#8217;d probably take a week or so to fix the

                <p>I was planning on posting something today, but I guess that&#8217;ll be delayed somewhat. Maybe. I&#8217;ll

                again. Here is my projected date for the first page of Act 6.</p>

                <p>I know, you are probably tired of waiting around for content by now, and probably aren&#8217;t
                    too psyched for another two weeks of downtime. But, there is seriously no way I can dive right
                    back into production at the moment. I have to prepare some stuff. The rapid pace of updates in
                    the past has always only been possible due to a continuously mounting stream of preparation and
                    forethought, and I have had time for neither over the past two months while dealing with this
                    animation.</p>
                <p>I WILL however plan to post a short intermission between now and then. I will let you know when
                    this date approaches.</p>
                <p>Then, when the 11th hits, we will be ready to rock again without looking back.</p></div>

            <div class="copy">
                <p>Ehhh I&#8217;ve got to get back to work soon so let&#8217;s see how fast I can knock out the rest of
                    this.</p>
                <p><!-- more -->Let&#8217;s continue from the point of all the stuff about Jack&#8217;s massacre through
                    Exile Town, and address issues surrounding</p>
                <p><strong>The big chess game</strong></p>
                <p>After all this, events involving the carapace people still resemble an extremely complicated
                    interdimensional game of chess. Everything the royalty does is strategic in the bigger picture. The
                    black queen was exiled, but found another way to fulfill her role through a complex maneuver of self
                    sacrifice. The white queen&#8217;s retreat from the session, after Jack stole the black queen&#8217;s
                    ring and wrecked Prospit and the Battlefield, was a defensive regrouping strategy on post-apocalypse
                    Earth. She formed an elaborate plan, most of which went unwritten but could be understood mostly by
                    deduction. Basically, she mobilized remaining exiles there, planned to leave this universe via one
                    of the stations, destroying them all behind them to burn the bridge, but not before reuniting with
                    the king from the time capsule. She also bestowed her title as queen to PM as her successor to rule
                    the new kingdom they would build, and privately bestowed the responsibility on WV to some day wear
                    the ring and hunt down Jack, wherever he might be. The problem is, Jack short-circuited her strategy
                    by appearing immediately after the king arrived, killed WK and WQ right away, thus finally winning
                    the chess game for his kingdom, or more particularly, himself.</p>
                <p>Almost.</p>
                <p>The final gambit belonged to PM though, when she found the ring, put it on, and inherited the true
                    powers of a queen, more than just in name. Neither PM, nor any carapace creature, can literally be
                    considered a pawn. But she is pawn-like in rank, as many are in this exotic and diverse race of
                    chess people, and being the only piece left standing, she put the ring on and became the most
                    powerful type of piece possible. Much like a pawn reaching the end of a chess board, and becoming a
                    queen. For now, with her and Jack&#8217;s powers being about equal, the chess game sits in
                    stalemate.</p>
                <p><strong>God Tiers</strong></p>
                <p>First let&#8217;s look at what happened to Rose and Dave.</p>
                <p>When Rose asks Scratch whether she will reach god tier, <a
                        href=http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=005530">he responds</a>,
                </p>
                <p>You have exactly a fifty percent chance of ascending to the god tier.<br/>TT: That&#8217;s a strange
                    answer.<br/>I know.<br/>TT: Why such a precise probability?<br/>Because, much like the decisions you
                    must face to complete your dual suicide missions, you have two ways of achieving godhood to choose
                    from.<br/><br/>Which was before Jack killed her, and John revived her with a kiss, leaving only her
                    dream self. When she died, this eliminated one of the ways she could reach god tier, the only way we
                    knew of explicitly at the time. This is by having a waking self and a dream self, both alive. When
                    the waking self dies on the quest bed located somewhere on the planet, the player&#8217;s dream self
                    takes over permanently, assumes god tier status, and wakes up on the battlefield, while the waking
                    self&#8217;s corpse lies dead on the quest bed thereafter. This is how John reached god tier, and
                    how Jade did as well. (Sort of.)</p>
                <p>Dave and Rose only had one life left. They&#8217;d both been killed by Jack, and then revived as
                    their dream selves. They only had the other means of reaching god tier, which we knew little about.
                    We only had Aradia&#8217;s example to speculate from.</p>
                <p>It turns out, the other way involves another set of quest beds in the core of the moons of Prospit
                    and Derse. Reaching god tier involves using the only life you have left, and dying on that quest
                    bed. Then, rather than waking up as a god tier on the Battlefield, the dead body simply resurrects
                    automatically, transforming then and there. This is the basic outline of the process, with some
                    caveats from examples we&#8217;ve observed.</p>
                <p>Aradia was always a special case, since she was dead long before entering the session. She began the
                    session as a ghost, and then a ghost inside a robot, which never actually counted as having a living
                    waking self. She was never alive from the start, so she always only had the one ascension method
                    available to her, by the death of her dream self, which had been sleeping on its quest bed all long.
                    It was not in the core of the moon though. The moon only had five towers, because she was never a
                    living player, and didn&#8217;t &#8220;belong&#8221; with the rest of the players on her team of
                    Derse dreamers. So her dream self was sequestered away from the others, in the core of Derse. She
                    reached god tier when Jack destroyed Derse.</p>
                <p>We also can&#8217;t be sure that&#8217;s all there is to this method. Is it a simple matter of dying
                    on the bed, or is more required? In the only two examples we have of this, Aradia and Dave+Rose,
                    they die spectacularly in an explosion of green fire. Is that among the requirements? This is
                    inconclusive.</p>
                <p>Also, god tier Aradia, Dave, and Rose were all unharmed by the fire during the resurrection process.
                    Dave and Rose&#8217;s case was so extreme, they actually <em>emerged from the core of a sun</em>.
                    Does the transformation method itself protect them, until complete? Or is it just the simple matter
                    that upon transforming, they are now immortal, and dying in the very explosion leading to their
                    ascension would count as neither just nor heroic? You may speculate.</p>
                <p>After examining all that, Jade&#8217;s ascension is simple in comparison. Her dream self died, but
                    she brought it back to life by prototyping the stuffed corpse in her grandpa&#8217;s lab, making
                    Jadesprite. So, she did in fact have a living dream self, so option #1 was available. This had the
                    side effect of turbo charging her god tier state. She not only has the Witch of Space powers and
                    immortality, she merged with the sprite, which was imbued with Bec&#8217;s powers. She now has the
                    abilities of a god tier player, a sprite, and a first guardian all in one.</p>
                <p>Ironically, the green sun which they were seeking to destroy, now powers two of the heroes opposing
                    Jack: Jade and PM.</p>
                <p><strong>The Scratch</strong></p>
                <p>This is all pretty straightforward. We saw John at the beginning, fighting very strong monsters on
                    the Beat Mesa, and initiating the Scratch with a giant Quill of Echidna, just as he was <a
                            href=http://www.mspaintadventures.com/scratch.php?s=6&amp;p=005766">instructed
                        to by Karkat</a>. He killed the monsters easily with lava tornadoes and his Pop-a-matic
                    Vrillyhoo Hammer, completed the full jagged mark across the record&#8217;s surface, and the whole
                    Beat Mesa took off towards Skaia. It was releasing its energy the whole time, causing the Medium to
                    crackle with that background energy you saw so often. Before it could get to Skaia, Jade teleported
                    him to her ship. Once it entered Skaia, it fully released its temporal energy, and caused the hard
                    reset, totally wiping out the session. But not before Jade collected all the planets, the
                    Battlefield, and John on her Propitian battleship, and flew through a gigantic 4th wall.</p>
                <p><strong>The 4th Wall</strong></p>
                <p>First of all, she didn&#8217;t actually conjure the 4th wall out of thin air. Remember when Karkat
                    told her to <a href=http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=005152">turn
                        the wall off</a>, and then <a
                            href=http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=005153">draw it</a>?
                    He was asking her to captchalogue an undamaged copy using her Pictionary modus, for this exact
                    purpose. The eventual getaway. So she had it on standby, waiting for the right time to use it.</p>
                <p>As she expanded it, and we crept ever closer to the completion of the scratch, we saw individual
                    panels from early in the story flashing backwards. From a visualization standpoint, this is just
                    reminding us that the scratch is in fact undoing everything we just read, all the way back to page
                    one, and starting over fresh in a different instantiation of the universe. But if you want to
                    understand why all that was literally being broadcast through the wall at that moment, you could
                    consider what happened to be on the other side of the wall: <a
                            href=http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=005130">Lord English&#8217;s
                        coat</a>. Why would the interior of the coat broadcast those flashbacks? No need to get into it
                    too much. Suffice to say, it belongs to someone purported to be a master of time.</p>
                <p>Will the coat still be there the moment they crash through the glass? Recall that this is all
                    happening &#8220;simultaneously&#8221; with the rest of the critical moment, which is the juncture
                    that summons him. When he is summoned, he may need his coat. Whether he retrieves it or not, we&#8217;ll
                    just have to see.</p>
                <p>What&#8217;s waiting for them on the other side, beside a big ugly coat? Recall the setup I had with
                    the <a href=http://www.mspaintadventures.com/scratch.php?s=6&amp;p=005933">two
                        4th walls facing each other, separated by one yard</a>. They will break through the wall on the
                    right, traveling nearly the speed of light, and presumably, break through the wall on the left to
                    enter another reality. If you were thorough during <a
                            href=http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=005595">Seer:
                        Descend</a>, you might have caught this excerpt on a bookshelf. &#8220;Though we adore Him we
                    shall never enjoy His beauteous Croak. We spill our blood on acres of black and white so they may
                    cross the yellow yard. At last in Skaia&#8217;s reflection through broken glass He may find the pond
                    in which He&#8217;s meant to squat.&#8221;</p>
                <p>The yellow yard, regarding <a
                        href=http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=005558">my self indulgent
                    spiel</a> about the degree of author intervention to expect, very simply refers to the physical
                    distance between the two 4th walls the heroes will pass through, to escape from a doomed reality
                    into one of promise. The heroes will coexist with me, the author, for the span of three feet, and
                    while traveling very quickly, for the duration of thee nanoseconds. This was always my tongue in
                    cheek way of quantifiably demonstrating the absolute minimum degree of influence an author insert
                    can have on the story, while not having none. It&#8217;s essentially a gag, but serving a practical
                    purpose in the story, and a very concrete, understandable mechanism by which they may hop between
                    realities.</p>
                <p>I am also pretending that my personal interaction with Doc Scratch doesn&#8217;t count as influencing
                    the story directly. It&#8217;s influencing the way the story is told, which after all, is what
                    authors tend to do.</p>

                    understood most of this stuff. Still, there may be a few things mentioned here that didn&#8217;t
                    quite occur to you, or some connections you haven&#8217;t made yet.</p>
                <p><!-- more -->The Flash answers most major questions still dangling in the story up to this point.
                    What happens at the critical moment. (Two universes are destroyed, creating the green sun, while the
                    kids complete the scratch and escape through the 4th wall. This has also been referred to at points
                    as &#8220;The Great Undoing.&#8221; From early in Hivebent: &#8220;<span>AA: and we twelve will behave simultane0usly as the pawns and the 0rchestrat0rs of the great und0ing</span>&#8221;)
                    We know who reaches god tier and how. (All the kids!) Which trolls survive, the fate of the exiles,
                    who wears the white queen&#8217;s ring, and how the blood got on Jack&#8217;s hand. That last
                    question was probably the most maddening of the bunch for a long time. The bloody hand was first
                    shown in Jade: Enter, and as Jack&#8217;s list of victims grew, his hand continued to be clean. The
                    list of possibilities kept narrowing, until we finally found out here, along with an answer to
                    another major question, how he actually got into the troll session.</p>
                <p><strong>The circuitous journey of Bec Noir</strong></p>
                <p>A summary: after he put Jade on her quest bed, he looked up and realized he didn&#8217;t have much
                    time. The scratch was about to wipe out the session. So, he fled the session through one of the only
                    ways available, by riding a meteor through a portal back to Earth. The meteor was the one host to
                    the frog ruins, and he tucked himself in the same time capsule the White King did not too long ago.
                    The meteor crashed on prehistoric Earth, formed the ruins, and waited about 413 million years. Then
                    the king came out of the capsule to greet the queen. Jack followed about ten seconds later to their
                    surprise, and killed them immediately. He exited the ruins, and AR began detonating the four
                    stations. These were rigged presumably as part of the exiles&#8217; unspoken plan, as a failsafe to
                    prevent Jack from doing just this, in case he found his way there. AR hesitated to blow up WV&#8217;s
                    station, because he knew WV was still trapped inside. At this pause, Jack killed AR, and quickly
                    entered the final remaining station to investigate, while (foolishly, it turns out) dismissing PM as
                    irrelevant.</p>
                <p>In the station, he found <a
                        href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003311">this device</a>,
                    which had been switched to the left side of the frog with the <a
                            href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=005166">queen&#8217;s
                        key</a>, most likely by the queen at an earlier point. Thus it would transport the user to the
                    session outside this universe, i.e. the troll session, as opposed to the one inside it, the kid
                    session. But it was out of power, and had been ever since <a
                            href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002657">WV flew the
                        station halfway around the world to find the ruins</a>. So Jack, looking for a power source,
                    located the uranium in WV&#8217;s belly, probably via his keen sense of smell as an omnipotent dog.
                    He ripped the uranium out of a hapless WV&#8217;s gut, thus bloodying his hand. He powered the
                    station, which both opened its hatch, and allowed him to flee from yet another doomed reality. He
                    likely knew he couldn&#8217;t stay in that universe for long, since he recognized the red miles
                    destroying it above. But he probably didn&#8217;t understand that would be his own doing from
                    outside the universe, hours in his future.</p>
                <p>Jack, bloody hand and all, then appeared in the troll session just as the trolls were about to enter
                    the universe they created, as we saw in <a
                            href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=004827">Jade:
                        Enter</a>. He then went on his murderous rampage through their session, some of which we saw in
                    quick replays during this animation. He destroyed all 12 planets, Prospit, Derse, and finally,
                    turned his red miles attack on Bilious Slick, destroying the very universe he just narrowly escaped
                    from. And in doing so, he contributed his share to the critical moment. His alternate session self,
                    Spades Slick, contributed the other part by killing Snowman, &#8220;simultaneously.&#8221; All of
                    Act 5 could be subtitled &#8220;Jack Noir Kills Everybody&#8221; and that&#8217;s pretty much the
                    guiding principle I had in structuring it from the start. Jack Noir has killed every major
                    character, in one way or another (with maybe a few exceptions, like PM), including the entire
                    population of two universes.</p>
                <p>Then, finally, as he viewed the aftermath of Bilious Slick&#8217;s destruction in Skaia&#8217;s
                    water-sphere, and noticed the green sun appearing in the distance, he saw PM enter with WV&#8217;s
                    body on the frog platform, the same way Jack arrived about 10 hours prior. After he left the desert,
                    she went into the now-open station, and dragged WV&#8217;s body to safety, away from the bombs, but
                    was faced with the universe&#8217;s imminent destruction overhead. She noticed WV had dropped the
                    ring he&#8217;d been hiding all along, so she put it on and assumed all of Jack&#8217;s powers.
                    Then, again probably due to enhanced canine tracking abilities, immediately knew where to follow
                    Jack. She brought WV, likely with the hope that he may survive, as well as his firefly Serenity, and
                    is now prepared for a duel.</p>
                <p><strong>Slick kills Snowman</strong></p>
                <p>It was established in the intermission that <a
                        href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003168">when Snowman dies,
                    the universe is destroyed</a>. (Relating of course to her 8-ball theme, and billiards rules
                    involving pocketing that ball, or scratching while pocketing it.) Hence, when Slick shoots her
                    through the heart with Scratch&#8217;s single-cueball-bullet-firing gun, the trolls&#8217; universe
                    (blue) comes to an end. Recall that <a
                            href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/scratch.php?s=6&amp;p=005769">Scratch
                        browbeat Slick into agreeing to take his gun and kill her</a>. With nothing in particular left
                    to lose, or live for, Slick complied, and more than likely took enjoyment from settling this old
                    score, even though it meant his own death too. Note that during the standoff, it seemed Snowman
                    welcomed the attack. This was, after all, the culmination of her role, both as the black queen, and
                    as a servant of Lord English.</p>
                <p>As the black queen of Derse, her basic role is to oppose creation. She wars with Prospit, and stands
                    in the way of the heroes who seek to create a universe. Since she was exiled from the session, she
                    could no longer fulfill that role. So she was offered another way, by Doc Scratch, in an agreement
                    of mutual interest. Since she couldn&#8217;t oppose the creation of a new universe, she could
                    facilitate the destruction of another. Scratch gave the queen the powers of Snowman, and bound her
                    life in some mysterious way to the troll universe itself (turning the typically red blood of a queen
                    to blue, the color signifying that universe). Which is of course, another giant frog much like the
                    one Jack killed, which we have never seen from the outside. Ironically, to fulfill her role, she was
                    bound to the life of a creature she loathed, <a
                            href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=004207">which happened
                        once before</a> in the troll session when they prototyped a frog. She was disgusted by the
                    transformation, and removed the ring, which lead to her eventual exile, and <a
                            href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=004211">meeting with
                        Scratch in the desert</a>.</p>
                <p>Her role as Snowman also suited Lord English&#8217;s purposes, as her death provided the mechanism
                    for his entrance, as well as contributed to the creation of the green sun. This appears to be a
                    pattern with LE, enslaving various women, who can only die by completing their term of service, and
                    vice versa. He recruited <a
                            href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/scratch.php?s=6&amp;p=005971">Aradia&#8217;s
                        and Feferi&#8217;s ancestors</a> in the same way. From the perspective of LE as a crime boss
                    rather than an immortal demon, he&#8217;s somewhat like a ruthless pimp. Whoever he is. This is one
                    of the few major questions lingering, in case you didn&#8217;t notice.</p>
                <p>Anyway, more to talk about, but enough words for now.</p>

                <p>Now to address the substance of the animation.</p>
                <p>It is not only long, it is dense. As dense as most other animations, while subjecting you to many
                    more raw minutes of this rapid fire data. The events are portrayed nonlinearly. They shift focus
                    between different sessions, planets, and universes, zooming into and out of them, showing them
                    shrink, teleport, or explode spectacularly. We jump to points in a character&#8217;s chronology in
                    the future, in the past, and examine frames of reference where chronology has no meaning. This
                    animation is cerebrally challenging to follow. But your understanding of it will be in direct
                    proportion to how well you understood the whole story up to this point. If you followed everything,
                    and remember the key facts, there&#8217;s a very good chance you understood everything in the
                    animation easily.</p>
                <p>So, let&#8217;s take a closer look at what there is to understand.</p>
                <!-- more -->
                <p>Might as well start with the biggest development.</p>
                <p><strong>The tumor was a bomb that physically contained both our universe (red side) and the troll
                    universe (blue side). It was counting down to the &#8220;simultaneous&#8221; destruction of both
                    universes. On detonation, it did not destroy the green sun as intended. It created it.</strong></p>
                <p>I believe some people thought they were witnessing the destruction of the sun when the bomb went off.
                    Though if you examine the scene objectively, there&#8217;s no reason to think this, other than that
                    it was the stated mission for so long. There was no sun in sight. They were drifting through empty
                    space. Then, boom. The sun was growing from ground zero. The fact that this misapprehension was
                    somewhat common probably speaks to how cemented the mission to destroy the sun had become as a
                    critical plot point. And maybe also, to how well Scratch deceived everyone on the subject.</p>
                <p>All of act 5, and to some extent all of Homestuck, has been the result of a very, very long con by
                    Doc Scratch. His power source, and the source that fueled all this calamity in many other ways, was
                    always going to be created in this way, by combined efforts of the kids and the trolls to save
                    reality. Part of his job was to make sure that happened. That was the secret part of his job. The
                    other part, openly stated, was to pave the way for the entrance of his master, which is triggered on
                    the destruction of the troll universe, as illustrated by <a
                            href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003991">this virus</a>.
                    It turns out that doing these two things is one and the same. No green sun without the death of a
                    universe. No Lord English either.</p>
                <p>You may retrace his conversations in light of this new fact. He says he never lies, and while he&#8217;s
                    certainly deceptive, I think you are hard pressed to find him saying something that is absolutely
                    untrue. He misdirects, and lies by omission (which is something he makes clear he doesn&#8217;t
                    believe in). But just about everything he says can be validated in some way. There are clues to this
                    outcome everywhere, hiding in plain sight.</p>
                <p>Consider his conversation <a
                        href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=005531">here</a>. He
                    speaks primarily in hypotheticals, about what would happen if they destroyed the sun. He says things
                    often arranged like this: &#8220;And it is certainly true that The Tumor you will deliver to its
                    location has enough power to destroy it completely.&#8221; He says they will deliver the bomb to the
                    sun&#8217;s location. He just doesn&#8217;t mention the sun won&#8217;t be there yet. He also says
                    its powerful enough to destroy it, hypothetically. Also true. He just doesn&#8217;t mention it won&#8217;t
                    be around to destroy, until the bomb goes off!</p>
                <p>There&#8217;s also <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=004941">this
                    tidbit</a>. &#8220;<span>TT: It is nearly twice the mass of our universe.</span>&#8221; Because it
                    is literally comprised of the detonated mass of two dead universes. And so on.</p>
                <p>Next up. Even though this isn&#8217;t a &#8220;revelation&#8221;, it should probably be bolded and
                    discussed.</p>
                <p><strong>Time and space do not work comprehensibly in the furthest ring.</strong></p>
                <p>How can the sun just have been created, when it was there all along, fueling Bec and Doc Scratch for
                    ages, and more recently, Bec Noir, Jadesprite, etc? See above.</p>
                <p><span>TT: The greater the distance you travel through it, the less reliably time flows.</span>
                    <br/><span>TT: And the more time you spend in it, the less reliably space behaves.</span>
                    <br/><span>TT: Time and space aren&#8217;t as different as you might think.</span></p>
                <p>So in other words, what really happened is Rose and Dave&#8217;s journey took them quite a distance
                    through the furthest ring. The longer they traveled, the less reliably you could place them on the
                    timeline. They may have traveled a few miles, while simultaneously wandering millions of years into
                    the future. And after another few miles, may have gone eons into the past, way before the green sun
                    existed. This is in fact what happened. The dark gods helped chart their course through this
                    spacetime maze to deliver them to this location, at this time. Take that for what you will.</p>
                <p>This is also at the heart of why the sun became visible to the trolls the moment it did, rather than
                    always being visible. It is not because it &#8220;just happened&#8221;, since the respective
                    timeframes are incompatible, and that notion doesn&#8217;t actually make sense. The moment of
                    Bilious Slick&#8217;s detonation (our universe), that was the moment the light from the green sun&#8217;s
                    ancient explosion finally managed to reach their session, after its long circuitous travel through
                    knotted spacetime. In fact, we don&#8217;t even need a complex spacetime model to understand this.
                    Right now, there is celestial phenomena happening in our universe that we cannot see, because the
                    light hasn&#8217;t reached us yet! It won&#8217;t for millions of years.</p>
                <p>The light from the sun is important to the trolls not only as a beacon, but as a momentary
                    illumination of a &#8220;straight line&#8221; through the furthest ring. If light can make it from
                    here to there through the broken space, then so can a meteor, as long as it travels fast and doesn&#8217;t
                    miss the opportunity. This is a decent reason for the urgent getaway, as well as, presumably, the
                    need to escape Jack&#8217;s ire while he is distracted. So Sollux went all out, putting a little
                    extra mustard on it so to speak, and reprised his ill fated ancestor&#8217;s role as <a
                            href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/scratch.php?s=6&amp;p=005960">helmsman</a>.
                </p>
                <p>Aradia&#8217;s chronology is also worth noting. She is not actually witnessing the birth of the sun,
                    as this (remember, nonlinear) animation seems to illustrate. When she <a
                            href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=005466">flew inside
                        Jack</a> to escape, the sun was already there waiting for her. Every time we have seen Aradia
                    hanging out in front of the sun, or <a
                            href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/scratch.php?s=6&amp;p=005898">hanging
                        out with Sollux&#8217;s (half-)ghost</a>, that was well after the sun was created.</p>
                <p><span>AA: i am waiting for friends to arrive</span> <br/><span>AA: they will need my help</span>
                    <br/><span>TA: what friends?</span> <br/><span>TA: m0re ghosts?</span> <br/><span>AA: no theyre alive</span>
                    <br/><span>AA: first</span> <br/><span>AA: there will be two humans</span> <br/><span>AA: they should be joining us any minute</span>
                </p>
                <p>She&#8217;s of course referring to Rose and Dave. And of course, at the time, we&#8217;re meant to
                    believe they will arrive in the moon they are piloting, ready to crash kamikaze style into the sun
                    and blow it up. There&#8217;s little reason to question this. But it turns out all along, she was
                    waiting for them to COME OUT of the sun! As freshly minted god tiers. The nonlinear flow of the
                    story was at every turn directing you away from the suspicion that their mission would create the
                    sun, rather than destroy it.</p>
                <p><span>TA: then what?</span> <br/><span>AA: then rest of our party</span>
                    <br/><span>AA: the survivors</span> <br/><span>TA: 0h</span> <br/><span>TA: so then, we made it 0ut here alright.</span>
                    <br/><span>AA: yes</span> <br/><span>AA: well</span> <br/><span>AA: they made it</span> <br/><span>AA: your body will arrive with them</span>
                </p>
                <p>Then the trolls, who are now in transit, will theoretically rendezvous with all of them at the sun.
                    And then what?? We&#8217;ll see.</p>
                <p>I think that&#8217;s enough to digest for now. I&#8217;ll make another part later, talking about some
                    other aspects of the Flash, like Jack&#8217;s convoluted inter-session journey, the scratch, the
                    expanding 4th wall and all that stuff.</p></div>

        <div class="post" id="about-eoa5-part-1">


            <div class="title">About EOA5, part 1</div>
            <div class="copy">
                <p>First, I&#8217;ll go into the process, and all the technical stuff about making it. It ended up being
                    around 13 and a half minutes, about 50&#160;MB, was split up into 5 separate Flash files strung
                    together by a loader, and used around a thousand art assets, not counting those imported from old
                    animations. Following about a 2 week break starting 8/22 to take care of other things, I started
                    more serious work on it, and took about 6 weeks to finish it.</p>
                <p><!-- more -->It was more than 3 times as long as Descend (the end of act 4) which was previously the
                    longest animation. But it took about six times as long to make! So, why so long? Let&#8217;s look at
                    some reasons.</p>
                <p>1) COLLABORATION OVERLOAD! - First of all, I think all the contributed art is amazing, and I&#8217;m
                    ecstatic with the overall look of the integrated results. But as strange and unintuitive as it
                    sounds, getting so many people to pitch in to such a big project actually delayed the process
                    non-trivially. I didn&#8217;t really anticipate the challenges of managing a project of this size. I
                    spent a lot of time up front planning, organizing, dividing things up into tasks, and communicating
                    with many artists individually. This is overhead that is normally negligible for smaller projects,
                    where I usually just charge right in and begin animating. Then, after distributing the work, there&#8217;s
                    the inevitable waiting game, while assets started coming back to me in pretty much random order,
                    which makes for a scheduling conundrum. There is also the need to process the graphics to be
                    suitable for animation, make little fixes and touches, or sometimes redo graphics completely if I
                    didn&#8217;t quite convey the requirements properly. None of this is in play when I work solo. I
                    generally draw fast, know exactly what&#8217;s necessary for the Flash, take just the right
                    shortcuts on graphics, format them right from the getgo, and drop them on the timeline. But on the
                    flipside, the contributors generally can take the time to render lovely backdrops and character
                    portraits that I wouldn&#8217;t bother with on my own, for the sake of speed. This is a big plus I
                    think.</p>
                <p>So the bottom line is, distributing work for a project of this size will cause the project to a) look
                    better, but b) take longer. That said, looking back, I don&#8217;t think I would change anything
                    about the approach. It looks great, and the time it took overall was worth it. I&#8217;d only revise
                    my scheduling estimates.</p>
                <p>2) FLASH SUCKS! - Flash is not good at handling big animations. At all. I tried doing what I usually
                    do, putting everything in one file, and hoping for the best. After about 7 minutes of completed
                    animation, it started locking up constantly. I tried a lot of things, splitting it up into different
                    scenes within the same file. Didn&#8217;t work. The Flash file ultimately caved in on itself, and
                    became corrupted. Luckily I saved backups, and tried a different approach.</p>
                <p>I just split it up into five different Flash files, published them separately, and strung them all
                    together through a loader file, which worked, but invited its own series of debugging headaches.
                    After half way through the animation, I was CONSTANTLY putting out technical fires with respect to
                    Flash. I&#8217;d say I probably lost two weeks to problems like this, which have been a total non
                    factor in previous projects, aside from the first few when I was actually learning how to use
                    it.</p>
                <p>The good news is I won&#8217;t repeat these mistakes in the future, and will know how to approach a
                    project of this size more efficiently. The good-slash-bad news is this shouldn&#8217;t be an issue.
                    I don&#8217;t see myself doing another animation this long for the rest of the series. Not even
                    close, in fact. This was, in terms of cinematic gravitas, the high point of the series. It&#8217;s
                    the conclusion to act five which all the setup demanded. It is the BIG ONE. A challenge I set out to
                    do, for as much as any other reason, to see if I could.</p>
                <p>ABOUT MUSIC</p>
                <p>I decided to use Tensei&#8217;s &#8220;Cascade&#8221; as the theme around which the EOA5 score would
                    be arranged a long time ago. Before he even made his <a
                            href="http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/album/strife">solo album</a>,
                    actually. I stuck with that idea through most of act 5.2. In fact, it exists in the first 1/3 of the
                    score largely unedited. There were a few alterations for the sake of keying to specific visuals,
                    like a significantly extended part, and the end was truncated to move on to the next theme. (I
                    believe the original is a bonus song in <a
                            href="http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/album/homestuck-vol-8">Volume 8</a>)
                </p>
                <p>All the editing was done by Toby Fox, who I worked closely with on piecing together the whole score,
                    which adhered to a strict timetable of visual events. I gave him duration figures, cited timestamps
                    on clips, and so on, and he worked with my mad instructions to craft something that functions very
                    well as a score to the events I had in mind. This is the opposite of how it usually works. Usually I
                    take a song that&#8217;s ready to go, and animate events to that song. Obviously there was no 13
                    minute song lying around, so some custom work had to be done. This was done, most speedily, in the
                    form of an extended medley, drifting in and out of different themes to suit the current action. Sort
                    of like an expanded expression of the EOA&#8217;s predecessor, <a
                            href="http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/descend">Descend</a>, which
                    was Toby&#8217;s composition I adapted for that purpose, thinking of scenes to suit the music. But
                    it was the other way around this time. Working on the music in this way likely also contributed to
                    the delay.</p>
                <p>The aim was not to produce a totally cohesive, air tight composition to stand alone necessarily. The
                    focus was on making a strong score. Concerns for scoring are very different from those for
                    standalone composition. Emphasis has to be placed on serving visuals, even at the expense of more
                    sensible composition practices sometimes, to set tone, fit the timing and such. So that&#8217;s what
                    we did, and that was behind my thinking in piecing together the various songs I did. Like the second
                    segment, Clark Powell&#8217;s <a
                            href="http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/flare">Flare</a>, edited by
                    Toby to fit the time allotted, and accelerate into the Snowman faceoff. And two pieces by Malcolm
                    Brown, who accounted for a big chunk of the overall composition time. <a
                            href="http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/savior-of-the-dreaming-dead">Savior
                        of the Dreaming Dead</a>, largely unedited besides transitions, and a custom remix I asked him
                    to do of <a href="http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/black-rose-green-sun">Black
                        Rose / Green Sun</a> to finish it, which turned out awesome, especially after a few more touches
                    by Toby &amp; co.</p>
                <p>Another couple facts to point out.</p>
                <p>- The breaks occasionally in the music are not necessarily unprompted aesthetic decisions. They
                    resulted from the fact that I had to chop the thing up into five parts, and switching between them
                    would invariably lead to sound skipping. So to account for this, we made the breaks as creatively
                    deliberate as possible. Like that gap of silence just before we start following Rose and Dave. Or
                    the silence when zooming out of LOFAF, into Skaia, then firing it back up on the Battlefield. And,
                    obviously, the dramatic pause before the bomb goes off. I&#8217;m calling this an art through
                    adversity situation.</p>
                <p>- I never give anyone, artist or musician, any more information than they need to know. Like I&#8217;m
                    not saying to Toby, &#8220;ok here&#8217;s where Slick faces Snowman and shoots her through the
                    heart, we&#8217;re gonna need something badass for that.&#8221; I give more open instruction. I say,
                    &#8220;I think the music should start speeding up here, and get a little heavier&#8230; maybe begin
                    quoting that piano from Flare at a lower register?&#8221; and notes of that sort. Then he makes
                    sense of it. As silly as it sounds, I don&#8217;t like spoiling stuff even for people working on it.
                    I&#8217;d rather leave as much a surprise for them too. Also, I&#8217;m always skeptical that giving
                    the contributors the full picture would actually improve the product. The process is more
                    interesting this way.</p></div>

                    hadn&#8217;t heard from him in a few days. So I just tried putting it on the dump site, as I did
                    before, figuring it might be able to sustain it for a while, during some off peak hours until the
                    better solution was available. This was not the case, so I took it down. I&#8217;m not out to break
                    anyone&#8217;s site.</p>
                <p>I&#8217;ll try something else tomorrow. In the meantime, please have patience.</p></div>

            <div class="title">The lowdown on 10/25</div>
            <div class="copy"><p>Some want to know if I&#8217;ll post it at midnight, or later in the day. First thing
                you should know, as of right now the hosting solution isn&#8217;t even a sure thing.</p>
                <p>I have something lined up, but haven&#8217;t heard from the guy helping me out in a few days. So I&#8217;m
                    not sure about the timing on this. I can&#8217;t go into more details on the solution than that
                    yet.</p>
                <p>I&#8217;ve heard many alternative suggestions and will probably continue to. To field a few of
                    them:</p>
                <p>1) I&#8217;m not going to host it on youtube. Or render it in video format at all. I don&#8217;t want
                    it to be a video. I want it to be Flash. If I thought I was going to end up rendering a video, I
                    would have planned the project for video output accordingly. Perhaps used After Effects. It&#8217;s
                    a completely different kind of media. This option is not going to happen.</p>
                <p>2) You may &#8220;know a guy&#8221; with hosting to spare, or such. While it&#8217;s a nice thought,
                    there&#8217;s a 99.99% chance his server can&#8217;t handle it. It&#8217;s a big file, and there&#8217;ll
                    be upwards of 2 million people looking at it at once. This will use more bandwidth in one day than
                    most high traffic comics use in a year. Sorry, but thanks for the offer.</p>
                <p>3) Amazon S3, etc? I&#8217;ve looked into a bunch of things like this. It&#8217;s expensive. Under
                    usual circumstances, it costs several thousand dollars every month to host MSPA. And I&#8217;m fine
                    with floating that cost myself, from ad revenue and sales, and making the business side of things
                    work to sustain it. This is a little different. A conservative estimate has the cost at $10K for one
                    day. This is not considering excessive page reloads, the aftershocks of hosting it for the following
                    weeks, or an unanticipated viral explosion beyond the already high expected traffic. Could be
                    anywhere from $10K to $100K to host this one stupid file, which is bankruptcy territory. It&#8217;s
                    not worth that to put out a little free entertainment, frankly. If I posted that kind of content for
                    such an audience every month, I&#8217;d find some business strategy to make that work. But I&#8217;m
                    not there yet. Also, I&#8217;m not gonna do some sort of fund drive to finance this either. I&#8217;m
                    sure that would produce some results, but it just doesn&#8217;t sit well with me as the answer.</p>
                <p>So I&#8217;m working on more creative alternatives for handling this. I&#8217;ll let you know.</p>
                <p>edit: Torrenting, megadownloading, etc are in reserve as last resort plans. It would be more ideal to
                    find a way to run on site though. We&#8217;ll see.</p></div>

            <div class="copy"><p>Because formspring is terrible. I discontinued my account. (Again.)</p>
                <p>Not only was it poorly organized and difficult to use, I think it lent the false appearance that it
                    was a viable way to get in touch with me. And a lot of people treated it that way. But it really
                    wasn&#8217;t. Many thousands of submitted questions went unread. It was not possible to keep up with
                    them.</p>
                <p>So I guess tumblr it is, because it seems to be the blogging software du jour? Basically I type stuff
                    and it appears on the internet. Sounds good to me. Then you can &#8220;like&#8221; it a million
                    times and chuck my posts into the furious echo chamber of reblogged material. Kind of like putting
                    my words out to stud with the memes, where they will be mounted inappropriately in front of
                    youngsters. Is that how this works? Yes.</p>
