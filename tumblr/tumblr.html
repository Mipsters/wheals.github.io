It addressed some important topics, so I helped nudge it along the viral pipeline. My follow-up advice on this is very simple: educate yourself.<br/><br/>Invisible Children has done a good job in getting your attention, and inspiring people. But like any call to activism or charitable action, it should be your invitation to research the topic more carefully, and decide what to do from a fully informed standpoint.<br/><br/>There are <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/invisible-childrens-stop-kony-campaign/2012/03/07/gIQA7B31wR_blog.html" target="_blank">counterpoints</a> to the message of the video. (Some <a href="http://visiblechildren.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">serious critiques</a>, and <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/www.invisiblechildren.com/critiques.html" target="_blank">IC&#8217;s response</a>.) The issues surrounding aid to Africa, especially those tangled up with its political landscape, are very complicated. They should be examined carefully before making charitable gestures indiscriminately. There are indications that Invisible Children, while well intended, may not be the most effective vehicle for your donations. If this is true, I don&#8217;t think it should be used as a basis to smear the group, or to be cynical about their motives necessarily. They did something good. They got your attention, and got people talking about something important. But then the rest is up to you, to pursue this intelligently and examine the facts. <br/><br/>I&#8217;m not gonna turn this blog into any sort of hub for education on this issue, or point you to a ton of reading material. All that stuff is out there for you to find, through news articles, tumblr exchanges and whatnot. I&#8217;m just offering a very simple reminder. Do your homework before getting too swept up in something you don&#8217;t fully understand.</p><p>** edit: deleted original post. After a lot more research, my conclusion is this doesn&#8217;t warrant the attention it&#8217;s received.

                <p>Thank you, Emily.</p>
                <p>Probably a lot of people who follow me already recognized the drawing, because they also follow
                    her?</p>
                <p>I think this is because she is one of these great artists out there who some people refer to as
                    &#8220;Homestuck Famous&#8221;?</p>
                <p>It&#8217;s kind of amazing to me that that&#8217;s a thing. I&#8217;m not even sure what that makes
                    me and I&#8217;m not sure I want to know. At this point I think it&#8217;s safe to say <a
                            href="http://rufiozuko.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">my man Dante</a> has achieved Homestuck
                    Fame as well, in addition to ACTUAL fame, making him all but unstoppable.</p>
                <p>Anyway Emily&#8217;s real good and I like her stuff.</p></div>

We received a ton of great entries, and I think people will be pretty excited about the results.</p><p><a class="tumblr_blog" href="http://fwugradiation.tumblr.com/post/18443098989/homestuck-album-track-art">fwugradiation</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>The winners of the contest have been notified!

There&#8217;s nothing anyone can or should do about limiting any of this obviously. It&#8217;s up to the readers to limit their exposure to all that material while reading, assuming they care about that.</p><p>The kind I was talking about pertains more to the day-to-day reading experience, if you happen to be hooked in tight to the tumblr community. If you log into tumblr one day before checking MSPA, and happen to see one panel splashed everywhere in a frenzy, of say, a character who people say might be kid Mindfang or something, then&#8230; well, that&#8217;s how they learn about that story development. Then checking updates become more about finding out how or why something happened, rather than discovering that it happened in the first place.</p><p>Some say tagging stuff with &#8220;update&#8221; or &#8220;spoilers&#8221; and then blacklisting those tags will let you avoid this better. But then, blacklisting those may cause you to miss out on posts discussing stuff you may actually want to read. Probably the use of the &#8220;read more&#8221; break is a better convention overall for handling spoilers.

                    It&#8217;s successful in every way that is important to me and has met all of my goals or surpassed them dramatically. It has been executed perfectly when taking into consideration all self supplied constraints and personal artistic criteria.<br><br>

                    I have a few really frivolous things documented in a text file. Most of the time it&#8217;s nothing more than a funny phrase. I actually maintain more rigorous advance documentation for SBaHJ comics.<br><br>
                    What&#8217;s on my desk right now is a little container full of ridiculously tiny dice. There&#8217;s also a fushigi contact juggling ball which I kind of suck at, and one time I may have hairline fractured my knee bone with it. There&#8217;s an opened bag of Reese&#8217;s peanut butter cups. Some more dice. Some super-magnetic Buckyballs clinging to the metal leg of my desk. A lamp. A tablet. Some crumpled sbahj sketches. Some other trash. Me hunching over it like some nefarious fucking fleshgargoyle plotting some shit.<br>.</p>

                    I&#8217;ve seen like one episode. It&#8217;s nicely done, but it&#8217;s a damn show for kids. I do some silly shit with my spare time but I am not a child.

                    This question implies there actually needs to be an external reason for something like that to happen.<br><br>
                    Shit like that happens every day, in millions of different permutations in a wide variety of social situations. If you browse the reactions to it, how often do you see people saying, &#8220;omg jane is me&#8230;&#8221;?<br><br>
                    Jane fucked up. She was put on the spot and totally choked. Then she kept digging herself deeper and deeper in the hole. She did this because she&#8217;s a teen. Even some people who are older than teens fuck up like this. Being a young human is often a mercilessly awkward proposition.</p>

When designing Prospit and Derse, were your inspirations or designs ever culminated from Anor Londo (a location) in From Software&#8217;s Dark Souls?

                    I was never an English major and most of the time in my estimation I don&#8217;t really come close to sounding like it. Most of the time I&#8217;m pretty casual and breezy with language, even/especially in the story, usually to go after what I like to call Big Laughs. But sometimes I attack statements with more vehemence for whatever reason, but usually approach these tasks as if I&#8217;m solving some sort of logic problem with words rather than engaging in what is recognized by big time scholars as the formal discipline of writing.

                    The answer to any question like this is &#8220;probably months&#8221; because things take a long time to unfold and develop. I update frequently but by the standards of readers&#8217; humongous appetites for more, the rate of progress is still glacial. There are things like animation time to factor in, drawing lots more new &#8220;plot advancing assets,&#8221; juggling a bunch of different story threads and so on. It&#8217;s a slow, steady creep, but it&#8217;s always going somewhere, and that destination has become reliably combustible.<br><br>
                    But making decisions to accelerate your plans because people are impatient is the same thing as making bad decisions. To put everything in perspective, think of it this way. Cascade didn&#8217;t happen 4 months ago. It happened about an hour ago, or maybe less. Because that&#8217;s how long it takes to read what I&#8217;ve written since then. It&#8217;s almost nothing. No matter what doldrums we appear to progress through serially, or what elusive payoffs seem to perpetually hover in the distance, all of that is insignificant and easily endured in the archival readthrough by the wide eyed and uninitiated. One who watched Cascade an hour ago is propelled through succeeding material still spurred by the energy and curiosity generated by that explosive multi-threaded plot crescendo. And if Homestuck were finished, they&#8217;d just keep reading to the end without handwringing over who&#8217;s gonna be introduced when or wondering why teen drama has replaced &#8220;real plot advancement&#8221; or stuff like that, because they don&#8217;t have time to form those thoughts because there&#8217;s always another page to click on. All those things are quickly contextualized and paid off because you just keep clicking next, while all the entertainment value is heavily compactified, easily compensating for the kinds of lulls or buildup measures that can absolutely torment some serial readers and push them to the threshold of bizarre histrionics and irrational ragequit oaths.<br><br>
                    Wait, I&#8217;ve wandered into the serial vs. archival reading issue again. This isn&#8217;t even all that pertinent to the question. But it&#8217;s a topic I seem to get into a lot because it&#8217;s important, maybe even THE most important consideration for how a story is perceived, i.e. the rate at which it&#8217;s absorbed. Few seem to understand this. And those who do often forget, and get caught up in kneejerk judgments that would never be made otherwise. It kind of blows my mind observing some of the reactionary dementia that crops up in a huge serial readership, which is a double edged sword: fun to watch the day-to-day excitement over developments, painful to behold the ubiquitous impatience and the corrupting influence that has on the judgment of content. In many respects it&#8217;s a very bad way to read a longform story, dribbled out in pages rather than in big chunks. Impatience among some generates toxicity over time, like they&#8217;re gradually, unwittingly developing a grudge against the story because of the pace they&#8217;re forced to read at. This then warps everything they see. As if a tainted a witness. If they crave swift advancement, then pages that do not accomplish this adequately like gags or character developing interactions become like personal affronts to them. Good material is like a slap in the face. And the irony is, the more they like the story, the more toxic the attitude can get, because they badly want to see it get somewhere fast, and they can feel let down or like the work is in decline because they&#8217;re forced to sit through its responsible, judicious development in realtime. But this is an almost nonexistent phenomenon with archival reading, which lends itself to a little more detachment and reservation as one cruises through the material at the speed of reading. Judgments are formed less at the atomic level of the story&#8217;s building blocks, a bit more holistically, and individual developments are never agonized over. They may ultimately not love the story, but at least the resentment complex that can fester in the space of the serial drip never had a chance to skew the result.<br><br>
                    Probably some people think it&#8217;s weird that I put emphasis on long term archival pacing when I produce a thing serially, page by page. I do think that is the only way to make something good in the long term. But aside from that, consider that by now the vast majority of the readership began reading relatively recently. Most current readers have experienced most of the story by catching up through the archives, so any attention I put on pacing that out with patience and discipline has directly benefited, it turns out: MOST READERS! This trend will probably continue as more pile on in the future and HS approaches its end. But then the funny thing is those people who catch up then dive into the huge serial mosh pit, and immediately assume the psychology and habits of serial readers, most of the time without even being aware of how radically this will alter their perception of all events that follow, better or worse. It&#8217;s kind of a strange mill of human perception I&#8217;m running here. A weird factory where droves enter curious, proceed fascinated, and exit frenzied. But while that process for them is quick, they should try to remember the factory took three years to build, and its construction is ongoing at the same slow pace it always has been.</p>

                    The damsel is somebody who looks like Vriska.<br><br>
                    Mindfang&#8217;s journal entries were always intended as narrative departures in which I would deliberately drag the story into what I call &#8220;The Bad Fanfiction Zone.&#8221; Without necessarily laying it on TOO thick (because holy shit, fanfiction can be REALLY bad), I specifically emulated some common impulses of fanfiction writers to open this backstory portal, to fill in some world building details and contextualize the arcs of the troll kids. It&#8217;s kind of bombastic, character-aggrandizing, uncomfortably erotic, and florid. I wanted to leverage the Bad Fanfiction Zone for useful story purposes, primarily because this was a funny idea to me. It&#8217;s one of those gags which I don&#8217;t expect the majority of readers to pick up on. Some people LOVE the Mindfang stuff because, among other reasons, they&#8217;re often the sort of people who genuinely like to read fanfiction! Whereas some others HATED the journals, probably without even fully understanding why. The reason is because I bombed my own story with bad fanfiction, and tricked them into reading it. This is absolutely the most hilarious consequence of this gag.<br><br>
                    But don&#8217;t get me wrong. Just because I call it the Bad Fanfiction Zone doesn&#8217;t mean I actually think the Mindfang stuff is bad. All the lore is good and I like the indirect filling in of events and details of alien culture as you&#8217;d reveal through study of historical documents and journals. But the execution is humorously heavy handed, somewhere between lavish old world prose and an enthusiastic fandom hackjob, and this was a conscious layer of the gag. And there are some people who do pick up on this.</p>

                    This is exactly the sort of thing that gets nibbled away at as the story goes along. A little here, a little there, without giant info dumps. It makes no sense for me to say now. It&#8217;s much better for people to invent their own rules, roleplay with them and stuff, and then for their ideas to gradually get debunked by canon.</p>

                    I guess I don&#8217;t really have those. When it&#8217;s time to write there&#8217;s always something to write. When it&#8217;s time to draw there&#8217;s always something to draw. I never worry much about how good any of it is so that kind of helps.<br><br>
                    I do have people blocks sometimes. Times where motivation is sluggish on account of let&#8217;s just say Problem People.<br><br>
                    I don&#8217;t know if being in a bad mood ever affects my work negatively though. I remember some patches of the story where I was not in a great mood, but you would never know it by reading that stuff. It always just comes out kind of the same.<br><br>
                    The truth is that an artist&#8217;s appraisal of his own work, in terms of how much better some stuff is than other stuff, is probably completely meaningless. If you grab a random person off the street and hold up two things and say this is my good shit and this is my bad shit, he probably won&#8217;t know what the fuck you&#8217;re talking about. 9 out of 10 people will probably say it&#8217;s the same exact shit.<br><br>
                    This is why worrying too much about the quality of what you do is kind of ridiculous, and worrying about it is what leads to blocks. In the end what you make is the result of your capabilities and your effort, and practically nothing else. So you might as well stop worrying, drop the bullshit, and just make it.<br>.</p>

                <p>Reblogging source of UU&#8217;s sketch.</p>
                <p>I asked Shelby to fill in as a &#8220;designated fan artist&#8221; for UU&#8217;s drawings and
                    requested a god tier Dirk. This is what she came up with. Let us stand together in admiration of
                    this masterpiece.</p></div>

                popping a boner. He is wearing a cod piece.</p>
                <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codpiece" target="_blank"><a

                <p>Which is like the whole point of a cod piece I guess. To give a guy some solid boner poppin&#8217;
                    space, thus maximizing his comfort while leaving a great deal to the imagination. We are invited to
                    wonder, what <em>exactly</em> is the state of that man&#8217;s erection? We may wonder all we like,
                    but his coy lips are sealed.</p>
                <p>Did I mention that sketch was canon?</p>
                <p>It is SO canon. You don&#8217;t even know.</p></div>

                probably pause updates for the next couple days so I can finish the rest and actually get these sent out

                <p>Here is a Lord English. Bear in mind these were requested almost a year ago. I am sure this generous
                    donor thought they had found a clever loophole and could find out what he looked like long before
                    anyone else did. Little did they know I had an ace up my sleeve: massive procrastination.</p>

                <p>Many updates tend to spark crazy outbursts of fanart, particularly those that introduce new
                    characters. It doesn&#8217;t even matter if the character is <a
                            href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=006375" target="_self">someone in a
                        fictional book</a> within the story. Actually, that probably only encourages it, since the vague
                    allusions to a much bigger story tend to capture people&#8217;s imaginations and get people drawin&#8217;.
                    And so there was this whole rash of cool Calmasis interpretations after that update. Not sure how to
                    point you to the preponderance of this work, other than vaguely suggest you look up the #calmasis
                    tag??</p>
                <p>Pronouns</p>
                <p>Probably most people regard s/he as a highly utilitarian concatenation for use when gender is
                    unknown, if somewhat awkward. It does carry the advantage that everyone understands what you&#8217;re
                    getting at. In this case we have no idea at all what Calmasis&#8217; situation is. The narrative
                    obviously leaves details of the book wide open. &#8220;Androgynous&#8221; is a broad term. Calmasis
                    could identify as a specific gender, without having it revealed by him/her, or by the story for
                    whatever reason. Or the character could be of an actual non-binary gender. We have no idea. We haven&#8217;t
                    peeked inside the book to get a sense of this. Maybe at some point we will.</p>
                <p>For those of non-binary gender, &#8220;s/he&#8221; can come off as dismissive, since it implies one
                    or the other. Probably not all that many people are even aware of the array of neutral pronouns that
                    are available, like ze or ne or <a href="http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=2079"
                                                       target="_blank">THON</a>. I&#8217;d bet the number of people
                    unfamiliar with them is quite staggering, which makes it all the more difficult to assimilate any
                    into language, or just drop them into a sentence casually. Pronouns are really fundamental units of
                    communication too, so if you swap one for a strange word people don&#8217;t know, it really throws
                    them for a loop. But hey, I&#8217;m down with the idea. English has been lumbering along without
                    neutral pronouns for too many centuries already. They have loads more applications than just
                    referencing people of certain gender identities.</p></div>

                <p>Since it&#8217;s all pervasive at this point, I won&#8217;t say much. Do some research, if you don&#8217;t
                    like it, <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/blackout.html" target="_blank">speak out</a>. The
                    bottom line is the bill would allow sites to be blacked out to US citizens if claims of infringement
                    are made against that site, or even against some of its difficult to police users, like on tumblr or
                    reddit. This would likely mean instant censorship of massive parts of the internet for US users.
                    Kind of like throwing tons of innocent people in prison just to be sure a few criminals wind up in
                    there too.</p>
                <p>If you&#8217;re like me, you probably get kind of ticked when these ridiculous ancient men in
                    congress, who have no clue at all how the internet works, get together and decide how the internet
                    should be for everybody. So feel free to let them know.</p>
                <p>I&#8217;m blacking out all pages on the site, except those posted today and yesterday, for 24 hours.
                    I&#8217;m only leaving the recent ones up to provide context for the little blackout gag.</p>
                <p>See you after the nap!</p>
                <p>edit:</p>
                <p>If you don&#8217;t know what I mean by the gag, wait for the <a

And it definitely was hilarious. I understand that not everyone thinks all of my e-impulses are a total riot though.</p><!-- more --><p>Before I launch into any more of this, let me reframe the key points which drove the previous post.</p><p>- You can absolutely craft an argument using story data that the kids are white. You are allowed to believe they&#8217;re white! That&#8217;s cool. I&#8217;m not saying that makes you a racist at all. Often I view them that way myself, if bothering to imagine them corporeally. I&#8217;ve also pictured John and Jade as Asian and thought, &#8220;that works.&#8221; These are just personal reflections and you&#8217;re free to form your own by any criteria, including hyperfidelity to canon minutia, <em>as well as by disregarding one or two ridiculously insignificant points of said minutia</em>. You have my permission. But most of the time I picture them as N/A, and my official answer when asked is &#8220;I don&#8217;t care.&#8221;</p><p>- What does strike me as racist is when someone gets <em>angry </em>over the suggestion that they could be thought of as anything other than white. And that does appear to be a thing that happens. It&#8217;s a position that irritates me. Enough to bother addressing it, and verbally crystallize some points on abstraction as they apply to race in HS, even if in apparent contradiction with one or two minor story details.</p><p>That&#8217;s pretty much the bottom line on this.</p><p>It&#8217;s aggravating to imagine a guy getting in someone&#8217;s grill about how there&#8217;s NO WAY John and Jade could be Asian kids or something, because some canon savant can cite an excerpt in the 300K word barrage of Homestuck which refers to the group of infants as pink monkeys. That isn&#8217;t really cutting it for me as a sticking point. Should we get out the pantone swatchbook, and verify that all non-white babies shall never exhibit anything like a rosy hue? Or failing that, what if some babies there were white and others weren&#8217;t? Digging even this much into it is already sort of treading too far into the pedantic bullshitification of the topic. Would submitting a &#8220;my bad&#8221; on that phrase choice help deflect some antagonization toward those with a different view? Cause I can do that. I can cough up a my bad once in a while. In fact I think I just did!</p><p>The retcon gibberish, I think we can safely TL;DR as &#8220;another fuckup.&#8221;</p><p>I do feel it&#8217;s all a little more complicated than it looks though.</p><p>I dropped the gibberish in place of the word &#8220;white&#8221; as a flippant faux-rebuttal to the obvious gotcha it represents. It was one of the earlier rambling dialogues where John alluded to Dave&#8217;s bro as a lame white rapper.</p><p>First of all, here&#8217;s what&#8217;s true: I was being quite serious when I said I viewed these kids as non-racial from the start. It is a fact! In the earliest pages, when people asked what race they were, I just said &#8220;N/A.&#8221; &#8220;Don&#8217;t care.&#8221; &#8220;You decide.&#8221;</p><p>But the thing is, this position had so much more to do with adhering to the fundamental abstraction in this world than it had to do with making any sort of statement on racial harmony or anything like that. The point was never to make something perfectly air-tight in terms of racial neutrality, as a means to create some sort of socially conscious advocacy literature. If it was, I probably would have been more alert in those early stages to make dead certain little tipoffs on race didn&#8217;t bleed into the story during some of the more outrageous, off-the-cuff character rants.</p><p>That&#8217;s the thing, especially in a lot of those earlier dialogues, I was somewhat less diabolically all-calculating than I became over time. In early chats I was more likely to flip on the &#8220;ridiculous rant&#8221; switch, and just write stuff that struck me as funny. It was just a funny thing for John to say about bro, which for the moment punctured that membrane between the way I was personally picturing a character for the sake of comedy, from these fairly amorphous rules of abstraction I established at the beginning. TL;DR, a fuckup. Then I kept making pages, kinda forgot about it, and am pretty sure never once used a racial qualifier that specific again. And I didn&#8217;t really care, because, and this is the important point here: <em>it just doesn&#8217;t matter.</em></p><p>And I could just &#8220;whoops&#8221; and again indicate how trivial and isolated it was and move on, but there&#8217;s even more to it than that!</p><p>At that point in the story, I&#8217;m quite sure I hadn&#8217;t determined that bro was Dave&#8217;s biological father. I sure as hell didn&#8217;t know Dirk would become a &#8220;playable character&#8221; some day (i.e. literally yesterday). So many aspects of this story were all coalescing gradually, and that even includes the extent to which race was a reliable ambiguity. That wobbled a couple times, but otherwise has stayed consistently unmentioned over the haul of several thousand pages. On that page, their whole ectobiological origin hadn&#8217;t even been conceived. Concepts like that were a work in progress. When the story began, Dave was just some kid being raised by some dude. That was as deep as I wanted the explanation to go, until further notice.</p><p>But let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re super bent on taking that retconned tidbit to heart. So, ok, Dirk is white, which means&#8230; what? Dave and Rose are at least half white? Alrighty, so be it! Don&#8217;t care enough to dispute the factmasters, if they&#8217;re immune to a nuanced explanation.</p><p>What I will dispute is this chain of conclusions. Dirk = white, ergo Dave + Rose = white, ergo all 8 kids = white, because I MEAN COME ON, WE BOTH KNOW THEY&#8217;RE ALL WHITE, BECAUSE THAT&#8217;S WHAT YOU WERE GETTING AT HERE, AND ALL THE &#8220;ENDORSED CAUCASIAN FANART&#8221;, AND THE PINK BABIES, AND COME OOOOON ARE YOU SHITTING ME. No, that conclusion is wrong. And the bluster behind it is&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; offensive!</p><p>If you want to back me into a corner on every last angle of this, and for instance bring up the example of how, say, an African American Rose is a &#8220;tough sell&#8221;? Ok, yes. I will be reasonable. I will agree that an African American Rose is probably kind of a tough sell for most people. I still just say, so what? Why even bother with ruling out that particular exception? If you want to repudiate people who draw her that way or something, go ahead. I&#8217;m not going to, because I don&#8217;t give a fuck. I&#8217;ll again just say N/A.</p><p>I probably won&#8217;t leave the retcon gibberish there forever. But I might leave it there until people stop giving a shit about this.</p><p>I&#8217;ll do one of three things.</p><p>1) Keep it forever, because: I don&#8217;t care.<br/>2) Change it back to white, because: I still don&#8217;t really give a shit about the mild, singular, isolated contradiction it represents.<br/>3) Revise the sentence to read more naturally and exclude the word white because: I don&#8217;t give a fuck.</p><p>Some people I think regarded my flippant retcon as a needless escalation of this to something like a &#8220;really big deal.&#8221; Dunno about that. So I stuck a garbage word into one marginal conversation 4000 pages deep in the archive? OH NOES. Story pollution. What if he never fixes it??????</p><p>I tend to be a little flippant with my own story, even where others perceive hallowed ground. It&#8217;s practically business as usual.</p><p>FINAL TLDR YO</p><p>There&#8217;s only one thing I&#8217;m annoyed about, and only one type of behavior I&#8217;m calling racist. And that is if you act all haughty and shit on people about how they absolutely have to believe all these kids are white. That&#8217;s it. It&#8217;s cool if you believe they&#8217;re white. I can&#8217;t blame you for that perception at all.</p><p>Happy Martin Luther king day everybody!</p><p>I really didn&#8217;t plan on gettin into all this on MLK2KXII. For real.</p><p>It&#8217;s like I was suddenly possessed and spurred to passionate oration by MLK&#8217;s legendary ghost.</p><p>Then he was like, man fuck this weirdo, and flew away.</p></div>                                                                                                                                                                                                            <a href="#iaeu-eeura">                            <div class="footer for_permalink">                                <div class="date">Posted on January 17th, 2012                                                                    </div>                                                                <div class="clear"></div>                            </div>                        </a>                                                            <div class="footer " style="                        display:none;                                                                    ">                                                                                                                                                                            <div class="clear"></div>                    </div>                                        </div><div class="bottom"></div>

I probably wouldn&#8217;t even bother responding but I kind of get the sense there&#8217;s a faction out there that feels this way.</p><p><em>&#8212;<br/>oh come on this race answer is unmitigated bullshit</em></p><p><em>don’t try to eek out a tiny bit of totally undeserved  race-representation cred when you are indisputably portraying eight  white kids in a row<br/>&#8212;</em></p><p>This is a racist response.</p><p>They are only &#8220;indisputably&#8221; white because of the social and cultural associations you are making yourself, between the backgrounds and behaviors of these characters, and those you assign to white people as a general rule.</p><p>Let&#8217;s look at John&#8217;s situation. An average looking, suburban, middle class household, run by a generic looking business man father who smokes a pipe. Culturally, there is plenty about this situation that says &#8220;white America&#8221;. But citing any of this as strong proof that they&#8217;re white is what&#8217;s racist. Are you saying a Hispanic family couldn&#8217;t find themselves in this situation, in either this universe or the non-fictionalized US? Are you saying a black kid wouldn&#8217;t behave like John? Or an Asian man couldn&#8217;t possibly style himself as a throwback era father? What exactly are you saying here?</p><p>Let&#8217;s pretend I&#8217;m coming out and saying John is Asian for a minute. What can you supply to refute this? Does your argument boil down to, &#8220;Come on Hussie, the cultural clues to a white family are all there. You&#8217;re being disingenuous. If you wanted to indicate he was Asian, you&#8217;d have left some clue.&#8221; So my question is, what clues could I possibly leave to this effect? Maybe make him good at math?? I&#8217;m frankly drawing a blank at even facetious possibilities. What racial clues, when absent, prove they must not be a certain race? Does the absence of African tribal masks littered around the house prove beyond a shadow of a doubt they aren&#8217;t black? Or is it just they fact they don&#8217;t live in a ghetto that rules that out?? Really, this entire line of thinking, i.e. looking for &#8220;supporting evidence&#8221;, is implicitly racist.</p><p>If you think I&#8217;m being disingenuous and pulling this a-racial thing out of nowhere, this is what I&#8217;ve always said since the beginning. People wondered about race, and I said the answer was N/A. These are templatized characters, and while many aspects of the comic are vibrantly colored, their skin tone is religiously left blank. Blank not as in white, per se, but as non-affiliated, as if they were lifted from a coloring book. It is this way because abstraction rules this universe absolutely. Abstraction rules their identities, the way they&#8217;re named, the qualities of their guardians, the way they pick up objects, the way they engage in dialogue, and everything about the game they play.</p><p>It is also a heavily templatized story universe. The notion of &#8220;character&#8221; in Homestuck is a highly malleable construct, as it is in certain games. So much of HS and Sburb is designed with EXTREME flexibility in mind. It&#8217;s designed to have your imagination fill in gaps, and expand the universe far beyond the boundaries of what happens in the story. Everything was built with this in mind. The alchemy system, to get you to wonder what items you&#8217;d make. The prototyping system, to get you to wonder what sort of quest you&#8217;d build for yourself. What planets might your session have? What god tier titles? Are there more than what&#8217;s shown? You&#8217;re always being invited to ask by the systems that are introduced, what more is possible through this? This was a deliberate feature of HS built in from the start. It was a guiding principle for its construction, and still is. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s a <em>very major</em> reason why it&#8217;s captured a lot of imaginations. So in this medium of intrinsic abstraction and malleability, if you&#8217;re suggesting it&#8217;s somehow flimsy or weak to not offer an iron clad ruling on something so trivial as race, I&#8217;m going to suggest you are very badly NOT GETTING IT.</p><p>And to actually get <em>indignant</em> at the suggestion that race is canonically non-applicable, because you think it&#8217;s JUST SO OBVIOUS all these kids are white? That&#8217;s the ugliness of bigotry surfacing. Bigotry not only blinds you to ways you are in error, but triggers an automated response of anger to differing points of view. And then you don&#8217;t even realize that&#8217;s what happened. It&#8217;s not a great way to be.</p></div>                                                                                                                                                                                                            <a href="#non-reblogged-reblog">                            <div class="footer for_permalink">                                <div class="date">Posted on January 16th, 2012                                                                    </div>                                                                <div class="clear"></div>                            </div>                        </a>                                                            <div class="footer " style="                        display:none;                                                                    ">                                                                                                                                                                            <div class="clear"></div>                    </div>                                        </div><div class="bottom"></div>

That is why I put stuff like that there, so people can figure some things out and feel cool.<br/>-<br/>-<br/><em><a id="cookieemonnster" href="#cookieemonnster">cookieemonnster asked:</a></em><br/><em>What is your take on Owen Wilson?</em><br/><br/>My take is&#8230;<br/><br/>Hm. This question is like a zen koan. In attempting to answer, my head has been purged of all thought.<br/><br/>I just don&#8217;t know what to say.<br/>-<br/>-<br/><em><a id="friendlyneighborhoodspidertits2" href="#friendlyneighborhoodspidertits2">friendlyneighborhoodspidertits asked:</a></em><br/><em>Why don&#8217;t all the God Tiers on the meteor fight Jack now? They could probably win, right?</em><br/><br/>Could they? Maaaybe??<br/><br/>Isn&#8217;t it a better strategy to do what Rose said? To regroup and confront him from a stronger strategic position.<br/><br/>Sure, they may be able to put up a good fight. But if you have the chance to get reinforcements, and potentially use overwhelming force, why not?<br/><br/>They know John and Jade are going to meet them there. Jade especially sure did look like she could do some fancy stuff.<br/>-<br/>-<br/><em><a id="whichtobehold" href="#whichtobehold">whichtobehold asked:</a></em><br/><em>Do the names of the members of the Midnight Crew have any relevance to the Trolls&#8217; romance quadrants?</em><br/><br/>Not really. But the characters have been associated with their corresponding quadrants a few times. Like Hearts Boxcars urging Tavros to kiss the girl, or Spades Slick getting all black romantic with Snowman. That&#8217;s as far as the correlation goes.<br/>-<br/>-<br/><em><a id="newdstuck" href="#newdstuck">newdstuck asked:</a></em><br/><em>Is there anything as a fanbase we could do to disturb you? because we&#8217;ve been trying our best and so far nothing has seemed to phase you.</em><br/><br/>There are a few times I&#8217;ve said &#8220;Ok, if the fandom does THIS, that will be the last straw. Gonna pack up my bags and close up shop. Nice knowing you internet!&#8221; But mostly as a joke and only muttered to myself, because if I said it out loud that&#8217;s exactly what people would do. They&#8217;d say, SHIT! WHY DIDN&#8217;T WEEEE THINK OF THAT.<br/>-<br/>-<br/><em><a id="rmsails" href="#rmsails">rmsails asked:</a></em><br/><em>Why don&#8217;t you rename Dirk to Dion?</em><br/><br/>I guess Dion was another option, but there&#8217;s no fancy explanation why I didn&#8217;t use it. It&#8217;s just filed under not so great.<br/><br/>Really, I picked all four of these post-scratch names way way way a long time ago. More than a year I&#8217;m sure.<br/>-<br/>-<br/><em><a id="metalnate" href="#metalnate">metalnate asked:</a></em><br/><em>Is that Ben Stiller poster in Dirk&#8217;s room there ironically? Or did they just not have enough Kamina posters at the store?</em><br/><br/>The small square Stiller, Wilson and Snoop posters are in Dave&#8217;s room too, in the exact same spots. When I made his room, I just used the Dave room file as a base, and left those ones exactly where they were for the hell of it.<br/>-<br/>-<br/><em><a id="simpleruser" href="#simpleruser">simpleruser asked:</a></em><br/><em>How many designs for the Alpha kids did you go through before settling on what you did? Thank you for writing the comic!</em><br/><br/>Exactly one. Which is true of practically every character.<br/><br/>Although, I did bat around the idea of giving Dirk a wifebeater like Equius. But it didn&#8217;t work very well with the hat icon.<br/><br/>P.S. I&#8217;m going on record with the position that a hat is the perfect thing to be on a shirt, forever.<br/>-<br/>-<br/><em><a id="guyisart" href="#guyisart">guyisart asked:</a></em><br/><em>Who is the most retarded character of homestuck?</em><br/><br/>This new character I will introduce really soon.

Do you still take some bits of the actual plot from these theories on occasion?</em><br/><br/>Recurring fan theories and trending points of discussion at most usually appear in the story in the form of various &#8220;shout outs&#8221;. But then later, given enough time, eventually some of those shout outs start to accumulate more relevance, as smaller things often do.<br/>-<br/>-<br/><em><a id="yamihero" href="#yamihero">yamihero asked:</a></em><br/><em>hussie what did roxy mean by dirk being an unintelligible bachelor?</em><br/><br/>Unintelligible? You mean difficult to understand?<br/><br/>I don&#8217;t understand your question. It&#8217;s ineligible.<br/>-<br/>-<br/><em><a id="skormi" href="#skormi">skormi asked:</a></em><br/><em>do you feel weird when fans dressed up as your characters come up and talk to you</em><br/><br/>This doesn&#8217;t happen outside of cons, and I don&#8217;t go to cons often. I haven&#8217;t been to one since&#8230; I think TCAF, last May?<br/><br/>Which is to my regret. I&#8217;d like to go to more. Frequent traveling is difficult and disruptive though. Hopefully I will do a fair number this year, probably beginning with TCAF again as luck would have it. Though something I have to weigh about that and events like it is how much I want to risk turning a mild Toronto library into a rabid den of outlandishly dressed teens. I&#8217;m not really sure the show&#8217;s organizers had that in mind when they cooked it up. I also seem to get a lot of invites to Anime cons now. As in, a quantity of invites FAR EXCEEDING the number of anime cons I thought existed. So I don&#8217;t know, maybe I&#8217;ll do&#8230; one or two of those? That seems to be my wheelhouse now, or at least is the wheelhouse my readers would like me to have. The animes wheelhouse. It could be fun doing an anime con in a sort of &#8220;WOW I SURE DON&#8217;T BELONG HERE!&#8221; kind of way.<br/><br/>But to answer the actual question, I&#8217;m perfectly fine encountering people in costumes. It&#8217;s fun, and they&#8217;re usually nice and friendly people.<br/><br/>The perception from my vantage may shift somewhat as the sheer magnitude of these swarms increases. Not necessarily in a bad way though. But really, what conceivable reaction to such hordes can a human have other than some form of disbelief? Something along the lines of &#8220;Wow, that SURE IS a herd of fifty Nepetas there. That is just like&#8230; a LOT of fucking Nepetas.&#8221;<br/>-<br/>-<br/><em><a id="arthurpendletonpillywig" href="#arthurpendletonpillywig">arthurpendletonpillywig asked:</a></em><br/><em>What&#8217;s the relationship status between you and North? Have you done the full yaoi?</em><br/><br/>The full yaoi is actually a wrestling move wherein one guy piledrives the other into a foldout table covered in anime DVDs.<br/><br/>No I haven&#8217;t roped North into that one yet, but man, when I do?<br/><br/>Game over.<br/>-<br/>-<br/><em><a id="rolloz" href="#rolloz">rolloz asked:</a></em><br/><em>Why aren&#8217;t you uploading 100 pages per day forever like you said?</em><br/><br/>Fact: The most pages I have ever uploaded in one day was around 25.<br/><br/>The joke was that that number is a lot and also that it won&#8217;t happen.<br/>-<br/>-<br/><em><a id="delicioushamsteak" href="#delicioushamsteak">delicioushamsteak asked:</a></em><br/><em>Well here goes anyway: When the session was reset, and the beta kids were supposed to remember nothing, why did Dave seem to have memory enough to still write the beautiful SBAHJ that was influenced by Terezi? Do he and the others remember some of the events in their beta session?</em><br/><br/>It pays to investigate questions like this more thoroughly.<br/><br/>Do we ABSOLUTELY know that SBaHJ was solely the product of Terezi&#8217;s influence?<br/><br/>Didn&#8217;t he scrawl SBaHJ graffiti on his walls at some point, unconsciously? Could she have &#8220;seen&#8221; those at some point and been influenced herself? If this is true, doesn&#8217;t that mean SBaHJ was always a product of his unconscious mind, and then brought to his waking awareness through Terezi&#8217;s help?<br/><br/>Something similar could have happened with post-scratch Dave, by some other means. Which means SBaHJ is a universally constant product of his subconscious, much like Rose&#8217;s wizardfic is of hers.<br/>-<br/>-<br/><em><a id="notchristine" href="#notchristine">notchristine asked:</a></em><br/><em>are the images on bro&#8217;s tv screen from that one weird porn website of people who are photoshopped to look like animals&#160;?</em><br/><br/>&#8230; there&#8217;s only one of those?<br/><br/>How disappointing.<br/>-<br/>-<br/><em><a id="christopher-fantastic" href="#christopher-fantastic">christopher-fantastic asked:</a></em><br/><em>Will we ever get any more insight on the origin of the Felt?

She wouldn&#8217;t like shit games.<br/><br/>Of all those systems I probably liked Gamecube the best. SNES was probably a close second.<br/><br/>I&#8217;m going to pick two good games out of a hat for both systems, and you may investigate those. Pikmin, and Earthbound.<br/>-<br/>-<br/><em><a id="darkcaro" href="#darkcaro">darkcaro asked:</a></em><br/><em>How much did the crane to hold Vriska cost? Because I&#8217;ve been looking into it, and crane rentals cost a lot of money.</em><br/><br/>The crane snapped in half and I lost my deposit.<br/><br/>I don&#8217;t want to talk about it.<br/>-<br/>-<br/><em><a id="guizhou" href="#guizhou">guizhou asked:</a></em><br/><em>have you ever considered watching an episode of hetalia? i think it would be very ironic and funny if you did.</em><br/><br/>I have not seen it and don&#8217;t really plan to.

Good.<br/>-<br/>-<br/><em><a id="sociallywokard" href="#sociallywokard">sociallywokard asked:</a></em><br/><em>Hussie!

Are they going to starve to death?</em><br/><br/>There are alchemiters on the meteor. Remember how Kanaya made Eridan&#8217;s wand?<br/><br/>As for things to duplicate, who knows what&#8217;s there. Sure hope Rose and Dave like troll food!<br/>-<br/>-<br/><em><a id="2buff2punch" href="#2buff2punch">2buff2punch asked:</a></em><br/><em>What tend to be your considerations when decorating the rooms for characters as they are introduced? Do you look at what would be funny first, or what relates to the character first?</em><br/><br/>Funny and relevant is often the same. Practically everything dropped in has some kind of significance.<br/><br/>That said, designing rooms is weirdly time consuming. Making those two rooms almost felt like the labor equivalent of doing a flash. It just gets so picayune and annoying after a while. I&#8217;ve said this before, but I&#8217;d almost always rather just DRAW than fuss over a lot of tiny bullshit.<br/>-<br/>-<br/><em><a id="sericereal96" href="#sericereal96">sericereal96 asked:</a></em><br/><em>Who do you consider the tallest of the trolls?</em><br/><br/>My sense is a lot of people&#8217;s headcanons have Gamzee as the tallest troll.<br/><br/>I&#8217;m gonna go ahead and canonically confirm that Gamzee is in fact the shortest troll of all.<br/><br/>Busted fan artists.<br/><br/>Busted.<br/>-<br/>-<br/><em><a id="mamsays" href="#mamsays">mamsays asked:</a></em><br/><em>If you really liked something you heard from the music contest, would you invite the artist to make more music for homestuck?</em><br/><br/>That is a distinct possibility.<br/>-<br/>-<br/><em><a id="the-eccentric" href="#the-eccentric">the-eccentric asked:</a></em><br/><em>You mentioned previously in the comic that your interference in the story would last one yard. Can you give us a hint on what that entails?</em><br/><br/>That was already explained pretty clearly I think. John and Jade ride across the yellow yard, and coexist in my universe for that exact distance. One yard relative to me, not them! I have said that you could also view it that the exact nature of my interference over this distance was to make it a much longer journey for them. You could view it that way, because it is true.<br/><br/>But this reminds me of a sort of &#8220;FAQ&#8221; which I&#8217;ve read in places sometimes but never addressed. It is basically:<br/><br/>&#8220;If one yard is your only influence, why did you kill Doc Scratch and rip off his leg? Isn&#8217;t that influencing stuff?&#8221;<br/><br/>No, because I didn&#8217;t kill him. This was also explained. When in my proximity, he goes unconscious like a reverse Calvin and Hobbes deal. Then I left, and he stayed asleep for just a little while, until the conditions for LE&#8217;s arrival were met. Then LE busted out of him, thus killing Scratch, fulling his claim that he needs to be dead for LE to arrive. Because his arrival itself is what kills him! This would have happened regardless, and my involvement affected nothing at all. Maybe if he wasn&#8217;t unconscious, he might have refreshed the scotty dog bowl once or twice while waiting around to become LE, and that&#8217;s it.<br/><br/>Ripping his leg off didn&#8217;t affect anything either. LE has a peg leg regardless. It&#8217;s a feature of his appearance, not a consequence of Scratch losing a leg. When I ripped his leg off, that was just another one of these serendipitous maimings you see here and there. Like how Vriska lost an arm and an eye, and so did Spades Slick, to echo the kid session prototypings. There&#8217;s no cause and effect here. It&#8217;s a recurring cosmic coincidence.<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-<br/>This reminds me of another one of these common FAQs I&#8217;ve never talked about. I&#8217;ll answer that one, then stop!<br/><br/>&#8220;Scratch said doomed timeline Vriska killed Bec Noir. Was she really that strong???&#8221;<br/><br/>First, time to get all the facts straight.<br/><br/>Scratch didn&#8217;t know if she won or lost. All he said was, though it would be a good fight and she&#8217;s probably outclassed, he wouldn&#8217;t bet against her. And why would he? Everything we&#8217;ve been shown about her suggests she always seems to find a way to come out on top, even if things look bad for her, or it seems like &#8220;karma&#8221; should prevent her victory. Mix in her dice roll powerup, her great luck, and who knows?<br/><br/>But let&#8217;s assume she did beat him for a second. Is this actually unthinkable, when you really break it down and examine it through video game logic?<br/><br/>She is:<br/>1) A god tier player, perhaps a number of tiers higher than base level. By how many is anyone&#8217;s guess.<br/>2) Extremely lucky, at the EXPENSE of her opponent&#8217;s luck, by way of her power.<br/>3) Most important of all: she rolled 8&#160;8&#8217;s on her dice.<br/><br/>Think about the last point. Imagine in an RPG, a probability based attack, where the strongest one had a 1 in 16,777,216 chance to be used, every time you tried it? If you tried using this attack once every second, you wouldn&#8217;t be likely to hit the jackpot for 194 days!!! This must be a ridiculously strong attack. It was the one used to kill the black king, and that was before she even got the exp. for doing so.<br/><br/>Think of it as you would an ultimate upgrade in a game. Like a Mario star. Sure, Bowser is way stronger than Mario. But if he gets that star, all bets are off! It is a completely absurd advantage she&#8217;s afforded by that dice roll, which is only made possible through her great luck. Her power complemented her personality, which was that of a born cheater. The only problem was, her advantages didn&#8217;t matter in a doomed timeline. That wasn&#8217;t how things were supposed to go. If she beat him, he wouldn&#8217;t have killed the big frog, the green sun wouldn&#8217;t exist, and none of this ever gets started.<br/><br/>But is it at least plausible that she won? I don&#8217;t see why not. The fact that it was a close match actually says as much about how strong Jack is as it does about her, when you take into account all these insane upgrades she had.<br/><br/>scroll<br/><br/>scroll<br/><br/>scrollllllllllllll<br/><br/>These questions are forver.

            <div class="copy"><p>Dick was sort of the only other viable solution to the Di__ puzzle. There seemed to be
                this whole big camp rooting for Dick.</p>
                <p>Dick is a totally inferior choice tho. Too on the nose. Hehe! It literally means penis! Why don&#8217;t
                    we just name him Penis Strider? Here come the laughs!</p>
                <p>Dirk is essentially equivalent, though less direct. <a
                        href="/web/20120118180519/http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0026857/" target="_blank">Porn star
                    pseudonyms</a> tend to employ a bit of lingual misdirection to convey naughtiness. You don&#8217;t
                    tend to hear about porn stars with names like Cockballs Vaginamouth.</p>
                <p>Dirk Strider is a 100% legit sounding porn star name. Which is why it&#8217;s the best name for him
                    indisputably.</p>
                <p>Dick&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; nope. Pass.</p>
                <p>Roxy is less controversial it seems. Not a whole lot else it could be&#8230; Romy, Rosa&#8230; and a
                    whole slew of way less viable things than those. Though some wonder why it breaks the one syllable
                    kid name pattern. Answer: there was no deliberate pattern. The troll names varied in syllables quite
                    a bit, which was your clue that the rule didn&#8217;t exist. The one syllable kid names were a
                    result of smaller sample size + coincidence. One syllable was never a rule, only a superficial
                    trend. Letter quantity was the only hard rule.</p>
                <p>While I&#8217;ve gone to the bother of making a super trivial post about all this, I guess I&#8217;ll
                    open the question thingy for a few minutes <strong>a little later</strong>. So you can put yourself
                    in prime position to overwhelm me with questions and cause me to regret the promise slightly. At
                    least this should deflect the hot surge of &#8220;WHY NOT DICK???&#8221; Q&#8217;s.</p></div>

For the next album, I thought it would be fun to open the music submissions up to everybody.</p><p>There seems to be a large number of musicians in the readership outside the music team, who often work on their own HS fan music or remixes. I&#8217;ve had quite a number of people express interest in submitting music to HS over the years, but to keep the team from ballooning out of control, I&#8217;ve had to draw the recruitment line somewhere. This strikes me as a nice opportunity to give a lot of other creative people a chance to contribute music. The music team was originally assembled just before HS began with the idea that I wanted MSPA stories to largely build and develop through contribution from the readership, and I think this album idea is very much in the spirit of that original premise.</p><p><strong>The challenge</strong></p><p>If you want to submit music, the idea is simple. Pick a character from Homestuck, and make a song for that character. It can be any character, particularly those in identifiable categories, like the eight human kids, the trolls, ancestors, agents, exiles, Midnight Crew, Felt. If you want to pick a character not in one of those groups, that&#8217;s fine too. Keep in mind there&#8217;s a decent chance that if your song is picked, it could be reallocated to a different character, since it&#8217;s expected we&#8217;ll get a lot of submission overlap, and it&#8217;s not going to be &#8220;The Album of 50 Karkat Songs!&#8221; So picking a character for your song is just a starting point for you, and we&#8217;ll sort it all out during the selection process.</p><p>You can submit up to three songs. No more than that, or they will not be considered! They can be for three different characters, or the same character, whatever you want. You can do remixes, etc. of other HS songs, but we&#8217;ll have to run it by the original artist, and they&#8217;ll have some stake in the song&#8217;s sales. Attach MP3 files in an email to the address provided below before the deadline. Do not send WAV files! Too big. If your song is picked, we will contact you and ask for the high quality file.</p><p><strong>Those details again</strong></p><p>- Pick a Homestuck character<br/>- Make a song for that character<br/>- Submit up to 3 songs (for different characters if you like)<br/>- Attach MP3 files to email (no WAVs!)<br/>- We&#8217;ll get back to you asking for a high quality file if your song is picked</p><p>I am hoping to include as much artist diversity as possible in the final list. Ideally, one artist per song. So while you may submit up to 3, if one of your songs is picked, it&#8217;ll likely be only one. If you have a lot of music you&#8217;re dying to send, hopefully the 3 song max will mitigate any agonizing decisions over which to send.</p><p><strong>Submission</strong></p><p>Send submission emails to:</p><p><span class="go">homestuckmusic@gmail.com</span></p><p><span class="go">The deadline is 6 weeks from now, on <strong>2/13/12</strong>. The album will be released two weeks after that.</span></p><p><span class="go"><strong>The Prize</strong><br/></span></p><p>If your song is picked, it will be included with the album! That&#8217;s pretty much the extent of the prize. You&#8217;ll get a cut of the album sales, in proportion with how many songs you have in the album to the total number of songs.</p><p>Also, if this contributes any motivation for you, I&#8217;m going to try to make a point of using at least one song from this album in a future animation.</p><p>I think that should be all the info you need to get started. Everybody is already super psyched to hear what you come up with. Happy music makin!</p></div>                                                                                                                                                                                                            <a href="#the-next-album-a-contest">                            <div class="footer for_permalink">                                <div class="date">Posted on January 3rd, 2012                                                                    </div>                                                                <div class="clear"></div>                            </div>                        </a>                                                            <div class="footer " style="                        display:none;                                                                    ">                                                                                                                                                                            <div class="clear"></div>                    </div>                                        </div><div class="bottom"></div>

                <br/><br/> You might have noticed I&#8217;ve scaled back the frequency of music releases somewhat. It
                was becoming sort of intense getting one or more albums ready for release every month. It also did start
                to feel like <em>maybe</em> just a little bit too much music coming at you all the time. I&#8217;d like
                to make sure the novelty of these doesn&#8217;t deteriorate too quickly. Hence a single release seemed
                like a nice way to mix it up for now. I would expect albums to come out closer to every two months from
                now on. <br/><br/> On that note, I&#8217;ll make an announcement about plans for the next album shortly.
                Preemptive tl;dr - it will be a contest. Details soon. <br/><br/><em>More misc. notes:</em> Still
                working hard on restocking WP stuff. Calendars soon. All garments, somewhat later (2+ weeks). Working on
                zip-up hoodie variants on god tier stuff too. HS books back in stock 1/3.</p></div>

                    same.<br/><br/>And even if not, I don&#8217;t actually think it&#8217;s that much to spend when you
                    take into consideration the amount of time between releases. Might take 2-3 years to get it all in
                    print. Spending a couple hundred bucks over that time isn&#8217;t much. If you add up all of the
                    money we spend on totally ridiculous shit over the span of years, the figures are always mind
                    boggling. <br/>-</p>

                    ability to speak to each other as presented through the comic. I.e. it permitted them to speak to
                    each other&#8230; WHILE WE WATCH! Do you think all the trolls were hanging out together, not talking
                    at all? Or Dave and Jade were doing all that frog hunting without a single peep?? That&#8217;s
                    ridiculous.<br/><br/>On the other hand, abstraction weaves itself through the Homestuck reality, and
                    it can be hard to pin down where abstraction is to be taken literally. The truth is, there is not
                    much distinction between the layers of abstraction and the reality they are meant to stand for. John
                    was both literally named on his 13th birthday, and not quite, because that&#8217;s silly. The
                    guardians are both literally silent automatons, and not really, as there is indication through
                    allusion they function as normal people too. And the kids went through a huge adventure, achieved
                    immortal god status, and even then had to gain a few more levels just to gain the achievement of
                    simple dialogue as a literal upgrade, as well as not literally, because that makes no sense. The
                    reality is inseparable from the way the story is presented and the way the &#8220;game&#8221; is
                    played. But those abstractions are also a facade for a more life-like reality beneath it as well.

                    I guess I&#8217;m curious as to whether you think that your initial plan is still on tracks in that
                    sense, or if homestuck might end up even longer? (not that i&#8217;m hoping or anything

                    all depends on the approach, and generally, how leisurely I am about its construction. As a rule,
                    the more leisurely the pace, the more diversions and detours and experimentation and silly messing
                    around there is, and the more it all expands. If I stuck to a &#8220;just the facts&#8221; approach,
                    it would be quite a bit shorter than A5. But then, that&#8217;s actually harder. Because that&#8217;s
                    compressing major story hurdles, major productions like animations and stuff, into a smaller amount
                    of time. It&#8217;s let&#8217;s conducive to steady consistent output. Economy, for me, for this

                    THAT far from the situation being physically reconcilable in some way? How much do we actually know
                    about the situation? What are the scales and magnitudes here? How small are they? Is everything
                    rendered to scale from my vantage, or is that more symbolic? What does shrinking something to do the
                    physics? Are the two frames of reference physically commutable? Are there things about my universe
                    that differ from the one they just exited, and they continue to abide? Jade did just call this a
                    &#8220;realm with unusual spatial properties&#8221; after all. There is so much we don&#8217;t know
                    about the situation, it&#8217;s impossible to make a ruling based on hard science alone. <br/><br/>The
                    because AH&#8217;s author insert says so answer: AH said he would limit his intervention to the
                    space of one yard and the duration of three nanoseconds, and so far he has lived up to that promise.
                    And bearing in mind that he also at the very least COSPLAYS as a hero of space, it would seem his
                    intervention might include purposefully stretching the amount of space they have to traverse, from
                    their perpective. In other words, while I did promise to influence the story over only 1 yard and 3
                    ns, I didn&#8217;t say it would also be 1 yard and 3 ns IN THEIR RELATIVISTIC FRAME OF REFERENCE!
                    (It&#8217;s the oldest gotcha in the book!!!) They are actually getting jerked around to the tune of
                    3 lightyears and 3 years. Does this seem like outrageous chicanery from an author insert claiming
                    minimal intervention? Yes. But if such divine meddling is inappropriate here, where a <a
                            href="/web/20120119050614/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_ex_machina" target="_blank">towering
                        mechanical avatar of an author-god</a> stands present, then where is it appropriate? Nowhere is
                    where. And maybe&#8230; just maybe&#8230; nowhere <em>IS</em> where.<br/><br/>Regardless, if you
                    accept that answer, all that&#8217;s left to explain is the author&#8217;s motivation for doing so,
                    which brings me to my final answer and also<br/><br/>The real answer: Homestuck-time and real-time
                    have always been married in a strange way. I started it on 4/13/09, and by my own rule, that became
                    locked in as the date in the story too. And then it became stuck there, for one day of
                    Homestuck-time, while real-time flowed normally for two and a half years. When they scratched the
                    game and reset the universe, it was time for me to start over too. So again by my own rule, I put up
                    the first pages of the new story and grafted the story date to the real date, 11/11/11. The new
                    kids, in a way, have been waiting almost 3 years since the beginning of Homestuck to take their
                    place in the story, and have aged accordingly. They have done their time in the shadows, living
                    uneventfully. And now the stated objective of the original kids is to join the new game. It is
                    apparently John and Jade&#8217;s turn to wait, in sort of a prolonged narrative hybernation, while
                    we spend time expanding on the new kids and their Very Long Day. If they are to eventually meet, it
                    will be as approximate equals in age, and no, not so that everybody can get busy kissin&#8217; or
                    whatever. For more fundamental reasons, that have to do with the way HS-time relates to real-time,
                    and essentially repairing the schism between these two clocks which resulted from the fact that
                    about 24 hours of story took nearly three years to make.<br/><br/>And understanding that, I think
                    the explanation that works best is not necessarily a physical, relativistic one, but more of a
                    metaphysical idea. That when they crashed through the wall, they have presumably entered the real
                    world, albeit for only 1 yard from our vantage. They have gone from HS-time to real-time. Given the
                    schism between clocks, you could say they are faced with a rush of lost time, all at once. Like
                    massive temporal wind resistance. So in crossing the yellow yard, they are forced to live every
                    second that passed here in the real world which they did not experience in their fictional
                    adventure. It&#8217;s the toll they have to pay before breaking through the other side and joining
                    the others. <br/><br/>As I said, this is the explanation I prefer. But there are a bunch of ways to
                    approach the issue.<br/><br/>Back to H questions.</p>

                    when Barbasol was invented. Critical stuff like that. (It still has all the boring normal holidays

(Signed books still will not be available til after holidays.)</p><p>The first batch of books is also likely to sell out soon, so if you&#8217;re intending to get one for the holidays, now&#8217;s the time.</p><p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p><p>Some notes on the god tier designs&#8230;</p><p>There are a lot of considerations here, ranging from practical to aesthetic. On the practical side, color choice has a lot to do with what&#8217;s available for hoodies. The selection isn&#8217;t as extensive as you might think, so that creates a bit of a puzzle as to which icon gets slotted to which color. The tee is often a different color from the hoodie, and the basic governing logic is the tee represents color of the hood in the outfit, while the hoodie is the main color, for a little diversity. There are a few exceptions, like the space tee is also black instead of very dark gray. Exceptions like that are also usually due to color selection limitations.</p><p>I designed the symbols themselves with an eye toward simplicity, verging on minimalism, and visual consistency within a developing iconic vocabulary. That&#8217;s why you see these latest two echo aspects of others. Life is a simple transform of a tilted breath symbol, while void is kind of a &#8220;hollowed out&#8221; space symbol.</p><p>In my mind there are some subtle aesthetic principles guiding their construction. Ways in which curves behave, adherence to radial symmetry at times, certain ways the forms are sliced and aligned, etc. I&#8217;ve seen quite a few fan made projections of the unreleased icons. While there are a bunch of nice icons out there, not many strike me as that suitable for the god tier icon vocabulary, at least as I&#8217;ve pictured it.</p><p>I think it&#8217;s another one of those situations where &#8220;headcanons&#8221; clash with the reality as unveiled. Probably some are interested in more diversity in form than what you see, where void ends up being largely a transformation of space? Think of it this way. It&#8217;s hard to get worked up at the dude who invented the alphabet because the &#8220;p&#8221; is just a backwards &#8220;q&#8221;. That&#8217;s part of the point of a vocabulary of shapes, to introduce some standardization and logical repetition of form. Simplicity is also key, from precedents already set. Time was just a gear. Nothing too inherently exciting about that. The idea is to use very simple, usually abstract shapes to convey these broad concepts, while also building a little self-consistent pictographic language.</p></div>                                                                                                                                                                                                            <a href="#a-bit-slow-right-now">                            <div class="footer for_permalink">                                <div class="date">Posted on December 7th, 2011                                                                    </div>                                                                <div class="clear"></div>                            </div>                        </a>                                                            <div class="footer " style="                        display:none;                                                                    ">                                                                                                                                                                            <div class="clear"></div>                    </div>                                        </div><div class="bottom"></div>

            <div class="title">Homestuck Book 1 &amp; Problem Sleuth Book 3 &#8220;Soft Announcement&#8221;</div>
            <div class="copy"><p>These books are now available in the Topatoco store.</p>
                <p><img src="images/PSHSbookphotos.jpg"/></p>
                <p>I&#8217;ve held off on mentioning them until now, so as not to crash their store. Regardless, people
                    have already bought a bunch since the word got out anyway. I&#8217;m not linking to the store
                    directly, for now, to stave off a little extra traffic. If you are very motivated to buy these
                    books, you may go to the topatoco site and seek them out.</p>
                <p>It&#8217;s not even a bandwidth issue really. The store runs on a database, and if too many people
                    put stuff in their shopping carts once, there are too many connections and the whole thing shuts
                    down. So I&#8217;m being delicate about how I get the word out. Tumblr for now, then the main site a
                    little later.</p>
                <p>I also offered signed + doodled copies, but those immediately sold out before I could make any
                    announcement. I&#8217;d like to get the offer back up as soon as possible, but if I take on any
                    more, I would have to take like two weeks off from updating just to get them done. And even then,
                    they&#8217;d take too long to get to people, presumably many of which want them before Christmas. So
                    I&#8217;ll probably have to wait for the holidays to blow over before putting the offer back up.
                    Sorry to disappoint you if you had your heart set on one soon. I can&#8217;t really make exceptions
                    either, even for higher offers, because that&#8217;s a huge can of worms to open.</p>
                <p>On the bright side, the books came out very nice! HS actually translates to paper better than I was
                    expecting, so I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll be disappointed. Book 1 contains the whole first act.
                    (But it will surely be the only book that contains a single act. Other acts will be distributed over
                    two or more.) Thanks to Chris Kallini for the nice work paginating the book, and Cindy Whatpumpkin
                    for her usual nice job on PS.</p></div>

                Garden? Hard to believe. But the good news is that the team of gastrointestinologists monitoring my
                condition &#8216;round the clock has informed me that the meal is well on its way to being digested. So
                that&#8217;s cool. Hold on while I try to remember what happened that night.</p>
                <p><!-- more --><br/>What happened that night was a bunch of internet weirdos walked into a Springfield
                    Olive Garden. The aroma of irony surrounding them nearly overpowered the garlic fumes, which are
                    typically strong enough to make the wood veneer bubble and sproing off its plane like the table was
                    popping a boner. Those internet guys may have strolled into that Olive Garden with recklessness in
                    their hearts. They may have been packing a titanic thirst for self abuse. They may have been fucking
                    idiots. But I will tell you right now, what they were NOT, was fucking POOR. I was prepared. I went
                    to the ATM and everything. I had fifteen sawbucks burning a whole in my pocket, and there were <a
                            href="http://overcompensating.com/oc/index.php?comic=1402"
                            target="_blank">authentic Italian slaves</a> in that building who would see to it my money
                    was converted into fifteen pounds of pasta burning a whole in my stomach.<br/><br/>We probably
                    flashed this cash around more than would be construed as decent, if we were in a place where decency
                    wasn&#8217;t Italian for &#8220;physically assault me in the restroom, please.&#8221; (&#8220;Decencissimo,
                    per favore. Sì grazie!&#8221;) The wad of hard collateral weighed down the table the whole time we
                    were there, and I made good and sure the waitress could see it up front so she knew we meant
                    business. The waitress was trained in a dialect I think OG Corporate calls Family-CasuAffable, which
                    primarily involves pretending that strange internet people actually belong in public, and every
                    inscrutable in-joke they blurt out is totally hilarious. She would be rewarded heavily for her role
                    in this charade, oh yes. Primarily through self-administered alcohol and pain medication after
                    hours, one can only hope.<br/><br/><img

                    in my wallet, the one hundred and fifty dollars had naturally sopped up much of my soul&#8217;s
                    heady puissance, and hot rainbow lasers were rioting from the eyeballs of seven and a half
                    psychedelic Andrew Jacksons all night long. This fierce little militia of technicolor A-Jax sitting
                    there on the table served a real purpose, and not just to remind everybody other than me how shabby
                    and unremarkable their souls were. It reminded us of the steep hill we had to climb that evening, to
                    somehow burn through a buck fifty at an Olive Garden, an establishment notorious for its bargains.
                    This is a corporation which manages to turn a PROFIT by hemorrhaging tornadoes of free bread and
                    salad by some dark fiscal entropy yet uncharted by economists. Their shit is priced to mother
                    fucking <em>move</em>, you know? And here we are toting madd-staxx, sashaying like the Rockefellers
                    into the eye of this pitiless food geyser, derricked to the earth by salmon stuccoed drywall and
                    stock gondola music. If someone put a gun to your head, do you think <em>you</em> could unload just
                    shy of eight Andy J-Bombs at an OG on ANYTHING? And by &#8220;put a gun to your head,&#8221; I mean
                    for the purpose of this hypothetical, and not during the ordeal one naturally expects to face when
                    entering the OG men&#8217;s room. Yeah, we weren&#8217;t so sure we could do it either. I mean, they
                    were already putting like five upended plastic lampshades full of breadsticks on the table before we
                    could even crack a menu and make a battleplan for carving up this soul money. Soul money which I
                    remind you I HAD to spend. See, there really was a guy with a gun to my head. His name was <em>THE
                        INTERNET</em>.<br/><br/>So you&#8217;ll understand when I tell you I pored over the menu in a
                    state of critical anguish over the rock-bottom prices, crunching figures on my iPhone calculator and
                    swearing louder than babies were crying. I was worried the Internet was too rich for my britches,
                    and we&#8217;d never manage to pack away 7.5 iridescent American fucking Lions worth of gutbusting
                    Familinguini®. But just as the harsh presidential scowls of those 15 Xander Hambones and their scorn
                    for my weakness could reduce me to ash, that&#8217;s when common sense finally set the fuck in. We
                    could just drink the money away. Hell, we already had a head start on that plan before diagnosing it
                    as the master stroke it was. So with a flourish of my limp wrist, I made a gesture probably deeply
                    offensive to Italians beckoning the waitress, and demanded two of the most expensive bottles of wine
                    in the house. Soon, two complex, full bodied little numbers were brought to us, each cradled in
                    white linens like a newborn king, and just like that we were already another $7.90 in the hole.
                    <br/><br/>The plan. It was working PERFECTLY.<br/><br/>The Olive Garden is good for two things only.
                    It is good for grand marshaling a harrowing parade of internet-driven baloney, as you can plainly
                    see. And it is good for getting hammered in. I honestly don&#8217;t know why you would go there to
                    do anything other than get wasted. The only other reason to go would be if you&#8217;re a police
                    officer replying to a 911 call furtively pocket-dialed from the restroom. Or if you&#8217;re a
                    health inspector, scooting by to pick up your bribe wedged under the dumpster out back. That&#8217;s
                    it.<br/><br/><img height="268"
                                      src="images/OGphotos4.jpg"
                                      width="475"/><br/><br/>Ryan and I would take turns ordering drinks; one guy would
                    be designated to name the drink to the waitress, while the other would follow with a snappy
                    ultimatum, &#8220;Make it a double.&#8221; Among the first rounds she brought us were a pair of
                    Venetian Sunsets, which we agreed to consume after a little convincing it wasn&#8217;t slang for
                    some kind of STD. It was one of those pink drinks that gradates to something not as pink, and you
                    aren&#8217;t supposed to drink it if you&#8217;re a man. But that&#8217;s a trick stipulation,
                    because a real man wouldn&#8217;t give a fuck. Any guy who balks at tossing back a Venetian Sunset
                    or a Parisian Ticklefight or a Chattanooga Handjob is in actuality a blue ribbon pony&#8217;s
                    meticulously primped vagina. (I&#8217;m quoting Ryan&#8217;s GPS device verbatim there, FYI.)
                    Jeffrey got some crazy drink that had so much booze in it, the glass it came in couldn&#8217;t even
                    hold all the booze, and the rest came in this odd, graceful little vial carefully placed next to it.
                    I don&#8217;t know what that was supposed to be and neither did he. It looked like some tiny flute
                    of nectar you&#8217;d give to an elf to make it stop playing tricks on you. <br/><br/>Clearly a lot
                    of alcohol was going to be taken in that evening. So we had a choice. We could either be treated for
                    alcohol poisoning, taking advantage of the OG&#8217;s convenient bi-hourly shuttle service to the
                    Springfield hospital. Or we could eat some of the atrocious bargain fare being carted to the table
                    at impossibly frequent intervals, to absorb some of the booze. This was really the genius of the
                    plan, here. Using the OG&#8217;s own cruel contraband, the free breadsticks, to <em>stave off</em>
                    poisoning. The breadsticks are really bad, and that&#8217;s not just me going, ha ha, here are some
                    more jokes. They&#8217;re straightup nastyloaves. Imagine one of those little Nerf footballs.
                    Imagine it&#8217;s stripped of paint and elongated a bit. Now soak it in bleach for a week. Then,
                    once it is white as chalk, bake it at 800 degrees for 10 minutes. Then brush the loaf in a thin but
                    powerful adhesive solution, and completely submerge it in a vat of salt. Put five of these loves
                    into a basket, and put five of these baskets on to the table every five minutes until the party
                    leaves, or is otherwise removed from the restaurant. <br/><br/>Is that enough of this story? I&#8217;m
                    gonna say yeah. The bottom line is, the plan was a huge success, in that we&#8217;re all basically
                    still alive somehow. <br/><br/>TLDR; the final tab was a little over $200, applied mostly toward
                    beverages, and a smattering of semi-edible food. We went home and took a long hard look at our lives
                    and drew no particular conclusion. North got in his car soldiered in the direction of his namesake
                    to presumably put in another hard shift of &#8220;being in Canada.&#8221; Rowland went back to
                    mailing way too many tee shirts to goofballs who like funny words on their chests, and maybe also
                    run for mayor?(??) Keogh, Green and Paperklip went back to get bossed around by Rowland a little
                    more, because that&#8217;s what he is, their boss. Softowl cleared her throat before Ryan got into
                    his car, and he said oh, looked embarrassed, pulled the Ms. Paint figurine from his pocket, and
                    eventually returned it.<br/><br/>Let&#8217;s never mention the Olive Garden again.</p></div>

                <p>Act 6 is a little over 100 pages long.</p>
                <p>We got introduced to TWO characters within the first few pages of the act. Things are already pretty
                    accelerated. We are spending time following them, while learning things about the other two
                    tangentially, through chat logs, just like we did with unintroduced characters in act 1. I know
                    people want to know all these details super fast, but just checking things off a big list, like
                    whose name is what and what all the circumstances are up front like we&#8217;re reading crib notes

                <p><em> Did you expect this comic to blow as completely sky-high as it did? </em></p>
                <p>While observing the way Problem Sleuth&#8217;s readership grew and looking at the viral trends
                    surrounding it, I did expect those trends to continue for Homestuck. But I don&#8217;t think I
                    pictured the audience getting this big quite this fast. In 5 years? Maybe. 2 years? No. If it keeps
                    increasing at similar rates, at the 5 year mark it&#8217;ll be something ridiculous that I was
                    completely unprepared for in my most fantastical estimates, and I&#8217;ll probably have to
                    reevaluate what the fuck it is I&#8217;m actually trying to accomplish here. 1 million readers per
                    day as appears to be the case now still seems somewhat manageable, primarily if I just don&#8217;t
                    think about it and keep working on stuff. But what if it&#8217;s like 20 million in a few years? I
                    don&#8217;t even know what to think about that. That seems like a weirdly disproportionate reality
                    for something that was just supposed to be a ridiculous little web cartoon one guy scratches out
                    with his spare time. That is more like a hit tv show that by some cruel mistake got trapped on the
                    internet leaving some poor slob to somehow manage. Hit tv shows that rope in 20 million viewers have
                    these entire networks run by executives who fly in private jets to make big time decisions for them
                    and figure out how to manage the monstrous demands of the public. And yet as insane as it sounds
                    given recent trends this feels like an outcome I actually should be thinking about and preparing for
                    in some way.</p>
                <p>This is probably as good as any reason to start ticking down the GREAT ANDREW HUSSIE CORPORATE
                    SELLOUT CLOCK. Like not even to make loads of dough. Just to bail me out of some looming intractable
                    clusterfuck, a phrase some thought would be synonymous with the story itself. Turns out it applied
                    to the ballooning readership all along!</p>

                <p>All of MSPA has always been both an endeavor of artistic and storytelling growth as well as my

                    habits of personal enjoyment. Watching TV, reading, playing games, are all kind of boring in

            <div class="title">Land of Souls and Olives, a Conclusion: Pasta La Vista Motherfuckers. Part 1.</div>
            <div class="copy"><p><a href="../blogspot/blogspot.html#soul-money"
                                    target="_blank">More than a year ago</a>, some people on the internet wanted to buy
                me a soul portrait, and gave me $150 to commission a mentally ill person to photoshop god lasers and
                dumb tigers on to my high school yearbook photo, or my driver&#8217;s license mugshot, or something. I
                of course refused, but graciously accepted the money anyway, and proceeded to labor over the spiritually
                meretricious document myself. I additionally made a somber vow to spend all one hundred and fifty
                dollars on a humorously mediocre Italian meal served at the Olive Garden, a chain to which American
                families compliantly fork over their dinner plans each year by the tens of billions, probably. I also
                pledged that I would record the endeavor carefully, in a drawn out faux-journalistic spiel that had
                loads of jokes in it. But since I&#8217;m currently weighed down with an olympiadic bronze statue&#8217;s
                fist worth of shitty pasta in my belly, and feeling a bit off, I give you this essay instead.<br/><br/>
                <!-- more --><br/>I should say in my defense that after pocketing the choice soulbux, I did manage to
                dog the everloving balls out of this expedition for well over a year. When I first sealed the pledge, I
                did so with a spirit of adventure, but this quickly gave way to an understandable sense of all-consuming
                dread. If I even suspected I caught a whiff of the unique melange of garlic and body odor which
                persistently howls from any Olive Garden&#8217;s exterior ventshafts, I would begin to shake
                uncontrollably. But these articles have always been mostly about conveying how brave I am, so it shouldn&#8217;t
                surprise you to learn that I eventually triumphed over this adversity to become way more admirable than
                the guy who climbed Mount Everest without a spinal cord.<br/><br/>In dogging the trip so bad, to be
                honest, I had some help. From God. Any time I reluctantly made plans to go to the nearest OG, which
                always seemed to be at least fifty fucking minutes away from wherever I was, those plans would get
                sabotaged by an angry wrathful God who hates me, and yet still took time to derail my Olive Garden plans
                because even He wouldn&#8217;t wish that on His worst enemy (which I probably am). One time last winter,
                <a href="http://qwantz.com/index.php" target="_blank">Ryan North</a> was in town
                looking to be shown a good time, so I was like, hey, there&#8217;s this Olive Garden thing I&#8217;ve
                been dragging my shit on forever, we might as well join forces and put a bullet through the head of that
                long suffering obligation. Because when he said &#8220;to be shown good time,&#8221; I misheard him and
                thought he said &#8220;to experience major gastrointestinal surgery.&#8221; Sadly, neither thing
                happened, because that&#8217;s when the Weatherchrist dumped five feet of snow on New England and we
                couldn&#8217;t even go outside. I never saw him again.<br/><br/>Flashforward to now, when I saw him
                again. He was heading into town to sign books, and we were both like, do we DARE tempt fate again by
                resurrecting the nasty reeking spectre of my Olive Garden pledge? Obviously we did (brave) and Ryan was
                richly rewarded from the malevolent Beepbeepjesus by having his car break down between Toronto and here,
                and he was forced to spend the night in a weird little town. Our mistake was probably in making the
                plans out loud or something, rather than winking via text message. Or in making the plans even remotely
                specific, by scouting out the location of the nearest Olive Garden, which was brooding somewhere in the
                fecula of New England&#8217;s black asshole, Springfield Massachusetts. Fortunately, Ryan shares my
                adventurous spirit and disdain for sparing expense, and applied about 10,000 Canadian dollars toward
                getting his vehicle operational. He texted me something like, plan&#8217;s back on tight brotimes, and
                after an involuntary series of spasms, I replied with something like, cool, as long as the rig is sturdy
                enough to launch us over one of the broken highway ramps to clear the perpetually flaming wall of
                garbage that surrounds Springfield.<br/><br/><img height="550"
                                                                  src="images/springfieldmass.jpg"
                                                                  width="475"/><br/><br/>He assured me his vessel was
                sound. He&#8217;s a modest guy and tends to understate, so you see when he pulled up to the curb in his
                once humble gray Ford, it was now tricked out Mad Max style for our journey into this shrieking gulf of
                hate. Ok that was a fucking lie. Just a little embellishment to make you laugh, ok? The first and only
                you&#8217;ll see in this essay. <em>Sorry</em>.<br/><br/>Other people starting catching wind of this
                plan&#8217;s curious brown stonk and soon the affair snowballed into a BFD. <a
                        href="http://www.overcompensating.com/" target="_blank">Jeffrey Rowland</a>
                was like, this sounds retarded. And I was like, awesome, Jeffrey&#8217;s on board. John Keogh was musing
                to himself that he couldn&#8217;t even remember the last time he vomited, so what the hell. <a
                        href="http://gunshowcomic.com/" target="_blank">KC Green</a> took it as a
                matter of personally directed malice that one was not supposed to be able to locate the bottom of the
                breadstick basket, so he snugged up his bib and said let&#8217;s goddamn mosey. Agent Paperklip and
                Softowl were ensnared by the promise of spectacle. The ladies get codenames on #OGnite. That&#8217;s how
                shit works.<br/><br/>We took two cars because that&#8217;s a lot of people. I went in Ryan&#8217;s car.
                Ryan has a GPS navigator, and in his own voice he had re-recorded all the audio files it uses for
                navigation, like &#8220;in ___ miles&#8221; and &#8220;take a U-turn.&#8221; This sounds like it could
                be the second lame embellishment of the story, but it really isn&#8217;t. When you turn it on, his voice
                says &#8220;Oh my god, do everything I tell you.&#8221; And when the thing is supposed to say &#8220;then&#8221;
                in between instructions, Ryan draws out the syllable almost sarcastically, as &#8220;theeEEEEEeeennnnn.&#8221;
                And when you miss a turn, he interrupts, &#8220;Hold on. Someone messed up.&#8221; Turns out we would
                hear that last one a few times. The thing is, if you want Ryan&#8217;s soothing, masculine voice to get
                you to your crappy pasta destination, you actually have to program the right fucking Olive Garden into
                it. We plugged the wrong one in, while Crew Jeffrey was speeding toward a different restaurant. The only
                thing worse than a big party trying to get to one Springfield Olive Garden is a big party accidentally
                trying to get to two totally different Springfield Olive Gardens, and anyway the last thing you ever
                want to do in Springfield is split up and divide the strength of your numbers.<br/><br/>So Jeffrey makes
                it to the correct OG about 20 minutes before we do, calls us and says, guys, there&#8217;s a 25 minute
                wait to be seated. I pause and say, there&#8217;s really that many people there on a Monday night? He
                says yeah man, I think they&#8217;re here ON PURPOSE. I&#8217;m like holy shit. As incredible as it
                seems, hundreds of Americans DELIBERATELY piled into this little stuccoed commercial building covered in
                idiotic Mediterranean trellises, and did so for ENJOYMENT, as a thing they ACTUALLY WANTED TO DO. This
                is it seems for many people a recreational evening activity pursued regularly, which they seek out by
                dint of something approximating free will. I had to doublecheck with Jeffrey, so like, these people AREN&#8217;T
                here as a culmination of a half-decade-spanning, barely comprehensible internet scam? &#8220;Yeah, man&#8230;&#8221;
                he trailed off, palpably spooked.<br/><br/>Team Ryan rolls in finally, and we gather for five minutes
                before being seated, puzzling over a gregarious public awash in their strange appetites. In the mirth of
                the environs and perhaps as a form of euphoric release after a long and arduous journey, I must have
                struck passers by as guy totally psyched about this piece of shit restaurant. A guy completely chuffed
                off his ass to be scoring exactly ONE divided by ZERO breadsticks tonight, shit, yes. Though to be fair,
                my resplendent soul was probably betraying my true feelings.<br/><br/><img height="355"

            <div class="title">Font size</div>
            <div class="copy"><p>You might have noticed a slight up-shift in font size on the site. The current size is
                actually the size it should be, and has been for most of the site&#8217;s existence.</p>
                <p>I have no idea when or why or how, but at some point the text got smaller. It may have been during
                    the last site redesign, and I didn&#8217;t notice. Or actually, I did, but in that timeframe I was
                    so up to my neck in computer problems, OS reinstalls and browser version upgrades, I think I
                    attributed it to something to do with my system rather than something in the code. I didn&#8217;t
                    really have time or care enough to investigate until now.</p>
                <p>Aliased, 14 point, bolded Courier New has always been &#8220;the look&#8221;, and that&#8217;s
                    reinforced a lot of times when you see text embedded in GIF images. Like you see <a
                            href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=001925">here</a>, and
                    lots of other places.</p>
                <p>If you&#8217;re looking at the text and it doesn&#8217;t look exactly <a
                        href="http://mspaintadventures.com/scraps2/mspafont.gif">like this</a>, you&#8217;re
                    not seeing the text presented in &#8220;the right way.&#8221; Which isn&#8217;t a big deal. I&#8217;m
                    just letting you know how it is, and how it was always supposed to be. I&#8217;m not that rigid
                    about this issue, since I always knew this format&#8217;s presentation is invariably going to be
                    device-dependent for the reader.</p>
                <p>The official text look includes the hard pixel edges. I never wanted the text to be anti-aliased at
                    all. I think smooth-edged courier looks hella gross. If you have Windows, go to display settings and
                    turn off ClearType, if you care to. If you use a Mac, you might be stuck with smooth text no matter
                    what. I&#8217;m not sure. But then, if you use a Mac, you&#8217;re probably in love with
                    super-smooth text regardless, so that&#8217;s cool.</p>
                <p>I actually like aliased text on the web a lot better in general. Maybe I&#8217;m just old school. It&#8217;s
                    sharper and easier to read. ClearType with a lot of fonts, especially small ones, is just bleary
                    mush. I&#8217;m not really down with the idea of screens trying to be paper. It&#8217;s a false
                    ideal, and it&#8217;s never been pulled off effectively, outside of e-ink on Kindles and stuff.</p>

                <p>There are only so many names that fit the format (4 letters), and people would just suggest them all.
                    I already have access to the field of all names to choose from. In this case I just went with some
                    super simple vanilla names starting with J and similar to the names of their counterparts. Besides,

                <p>Without commenting on why he has that name or any of the other stuff, I will say that I think, HS
                    story ramifications notwithstanding, Jake English actually is a pretty badass name for a dude. Also,
                    it means he has the same initials as John.</p>

                <p><em><a href="#katrka" id="katrka">katrka</a> asked
                    you: </em></p>
                <p><em> How excited were you to get to this act and reveal these new characters? </em></p>
                <p>It’s hard to say, because most of the excitement over the idea was generated when the idea itself was
                    formed, which was around two years ago. The whole kid-guardian swap thing grew out of the
                    development of their ectobiological origin story, and I thought it was a fun idea to build toward.
                    In fact, a huge amount of the way I structured the plot was centered around this idea. A big part of
                    the inspiration for the hard reset concept was to facilitate this idea I thought had a lot of
                    exciting potential.</p>
                <p>But then after the excitement of the initial conceptualization, there’s the long trek to get there,
                    accompanied by grueling labors of execution. There were pockets of time when excitement was
                    reinvigorated, like during weeks of tedious animation, it’s hard not to think “man it sure would be
                    way more fun to make some new kids go on cool adventures instead of this bullshit.” But for the most
                    part, once it was time to put the idea in play, it had been around in my head so long, the reaction
                    is more like “welp, here we are.”</p>
                <p>Additionally, because this idea was around for so long, there is a huge amount of foreshadowing
                    groundwork laid for it, much of which is barely veiled. By the time we got into the little backstory
                    arc about the scratched ancestor session and their swapped roles, it was pretty loud and clear. That
                    was like me sitting in a lifeguard tower yelling in a bullhorn “GET READY FOR THE KID GUARDIAN
                    SESSION, THIS IS WHAT’S HAPPENING.” There are lots of major curveballs thrown at you in HS. I
                    personally don’t think this was one.</p>

                <p>Well, the deal is that somebody, somewhere, is sitting at a computer.</p>
                <p>The computer has a Caduceus symbol on it, which is sometimes, but not definitively, associated with
                    the 13th zodiac sign, which contrary to recent news, is not a new addition to astrology. It’s been
                    around for centuries, but was not incorporated into the zodiac most people are familiar with, for
                    whatever reason. Hence, the “13th troll” has been a point of furious speculation since the first
                    appearance of the trolls in the story. So…</p>

                <p><em> what’s the sweet bro and hella jeff moive plot? </em></p>
                <p>I don’t know, but I think plot is probably the wrong word.</p>
                <p>Opening the film with a ten minute montage of bro falling down some stairs would probably be the
                    conservative approach. Just some really solid stage setting, established in classical film making
                    tradition to butter up the critics. It also clearly sets up a strong antagonist for the moive,
                    stairs. It is a foe which is never bested, for you see, the film is an American tragedy.</p>
                <p>Other than that, probably lots of profane non sequitur and hug bumps issued by Wilson and Stiller,
                    who will have been heavily coached in their acting to achieve a sort of rigid, surrealistic demeanor
                    just off the mark of any heretofore observed human behavior. Like the uncanny valley of mannerism.
                    Lace heavily with artifacts, visual and audible, and don’t be surprised if at some point a 20 minute
                    clip of a completely different movie is inserted, uncut, flipped vertically, and tortured with
                    various Photoshop filters. Finally, the climax will be the stunning resolution to a series of
                    dilemmas not previously introduced in the film, all of which center around the inability of either
                    character to perform simple motor functions. Then we see oversaturated low quality footage of Tony
                    Hawk doing grinds while the credits roll, which contain not a single word which isn’t “fuck.”</p>

                    I’VE BEEN CRYING FOR MONTHS AND IT WONT STOP AAAHHH </em></p>
                <p>The thing is, Homestuck is both a story and a puzzle, by design and by definition. If asked to define
                    it, “a story that’s also a puzzle” is as close to true as any answer I’d give.</p>
                <p>Should all entertainment be like that? No way. But <em>something</em> should be like that, because
                    something like that should exist. That’s why puzzles exist, because puzzles are cool sometimes, and
                    are challenging. We don’t go up to a jigsaw puzzle and go, “why the fuck is this in so many
                    different PIECES, what kind of IDIOT would break this nice picture into TINY LITTLE BITS?!!” Nor do
                    we want all of our nice pictures broken into bits like that. Some we just want to hang on walls and
                    look at.</p>
                <p>But unlike a jigsaw puzzle, there’s much to enjoy without having to solve it. Fun characters and
                    silly moments. But if you turn your brain on, you can engage with the complexity and depth. If you
                    turn it ALL the way on, you can get everything, and solve the puzzle. There is a range of ways to
                    interface with it, from the casual to the maniacal. Failing to grasp everything shouldn’t preclude
                    basic enjoyment, nor is it a symptom of failure by either the reader or the story.</p>

            <div class="title">LE factoids</div>
            <div class="copy">
                <p>Later I might open the tumblr question box dealie for like ten minutes, let about a thousand silly
                    questions flood in, then shut it off and answer a few. But for now I might as well address a few
                    points of curiosity preemptively on the latest animation, and LE in general.</p>
                <p>Everything here&#8217;s based on some general line of inquiry I&#8217;ve seen posted elsewhere more
                    than once.</p>
                <p><!-- more --><strong>Where is this happening? Where is Scratch&#8217;s wrecked apartment
                    floating?</strong> It&#8217;s free-floating debris from the two universes destroyed, which now
                    comprise the green sun. That floating hunk of building is suspended, and temporarily preserved in,
                    let&#8217;s call it a small pocket of green-hot spacetime soup inside the sun. Chronologically, this
                    little pocket of space is very near the final dying moment of the troll universe, where LE makes his
                    entrance. He then goes back in time to fuck shit up throughout the history of that universe, as has
                    been described many times. That is why he was always &#8220;already there.&#8221; It is also
                    because, as it turns out, he was lurking dormant in Scratch&#8217;s puppet-host body the whole time.
                    Doc always did claim to be excellent host.</p>
                <p><strong>Is Scratch literally Lord English? Or has LE completely replaced him? How much of Scratch&#8217;s
                    cognizance/personality/being is still in LE?</strong> Well, here&#8217;s what the story told us.
                    Scratch said he had to die for LE to be brought into this universe. Now we have seen why explicitly.
                    Scratch doesn&#8217;t lie, when it comes to simple statements of fact. He only excludes details and
                    clarification. So, he is now dead. LE has officially replaced him, albeit traveled back in time to
                    coexist with him, presumably continuing to utilize him as an employee, in all the ways we know
                    about, and maybe others we don&#8217;t. They&#8217;re separate entities. Though because they share
                    the same body more or less, and essentially the same origin, they share properties. Both have the
                    powers of a first guardian (though Scratch said outright LE was more powerful than him). Both have
                    &#8220;Cal genes,&#8221; whatever the hell that means. In LE&#8217;s case, the resemblance is
                    obvious. They share an interest in the ladies (Scratch takes a shining to younger ones while LE
                    ropes more mature females into service. Reasoning? Scratch is a young LE!) They appear to have
                    opposite demeanors though. Scratch is calm, calculating, manipulative. English is brutal, angry, and
                    out to wreak havoc on a universe without any particular desire for subtlety. Their appearances
                    reflect the differences. Is LE omniscient like Scratch? There&#8217;s evidence that he&#8217;s a
                    strong tactician and adept with time travel, but its unclear whether he maintains the omniscience
                    post-transformation. Consider that Scratch&#8217;s omniscience was closely tied to the other half of
                    his genetic makeup, a magic cueball which had all the answers to everything concealed within. When
                    LE transformed, he kept all the Cal properties (magnified them actually), but dropped the cueball
                    aspect. In fact, his cueball head exploded outright. This was &#8220;the break&#8221; Scratch
                    referred to once or twice. A literal description of LE&#8217;s emergence, as well as reference to
                    the pool term, where the cueball scatters all the other balls, and the game begins.</p>
                <p><strong><a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=005500">T1CK</a> <a

                    HONK</a></strong>. This is not a question, but some notes anyway. This string of genetic code
                    letters is probably the most clear and present foreshadowing of LE&#8217;s transformation. It is
                    practically a brief sentence describing the process, in order, culminating in LE&#8217;s vast honk.
                    I think this one clue got some people speculating, correctly, that LE would emerge in some way from
                    Scratch, involving his head breaking open. Probably a minority theory, but it was out there, because
                    the clues were there. Revelations in a story are shocking in proportion to how little groundwork was
                    laid for that development, and how obscured the clues were, if they even existed at all. It would
                    have been more startling if LE turned out to be some ridiculous preexisting character, like
                    Maplehoof or Charles Dutton or whatever, but the shock value would come with no credible basis in
                    the narrative. So big reveals like this always come with sort of a balancing act of establishing
                    clues to make the event credible and premeditated, while obscuring/misdirecting so as not to totally
                    blow it. No matter how well you disguise it, if the clues are there, some will guess it. Personally,
                    I feel like the shock value is not so much stored in the fact that Scratch = LE, but in the sudden,
                    disturbing nature and presentation of the transformation itself. And hey, if the Scratch = LE tidbit
                    happened to catch you way off guard, I&#8217;ll consider it a bonus.</p>
                <p><strong>Why&#8217;s LE honking like Gamzee???</strong> If you&#8217;re prepared to be very literal,
                    you might believe LE&#8217;s honking is a symptom of Gamzee&#8217;s influence in some way, due to
                    time shenanigans or what have you. Examined logically, it&#8217;s the other way around. On LE&#8217;s
                    arrival, he releases the vast honk Gamzee&#8217;s religion foretold. LE has always been around
                    influencing troll culture from the start, and it seems he was always the embodiment of the mirthful
                    messiahs the highbloods worshiped, since he was really two beings, Doc Scratch and LE, both &#8220;mirthful&#8221;
                    puppet-based entities, in their own ways. Gamzee&#8217;s honking, the humorous brutality of the
                    subjugglators and their dark spiritual beliefs, all could be traced to LE. The vast honk clip was
                    actually a heavily modified sound clip of a bike horn, like one of Gamzee&#8217;s, slowed way down.
                    First a small honk from the squeeze, then a big one from the unsqueeze. Sounds a lot like the noise
                    the tripods made in War of the Worlds, which has me convinced those were made from slowed down bike
                    horns too.</p>
                <p><strong>What&#8217;s with the sarcophagus?</strong> That is actually the alternate form of the <a
                        href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003153">Cairo Overcoat</a>,
                    which doubles as his notorious oversized garment, and his chariot in which he travels through time,
                    not terribly unlike Dr. Who&#8217;s TARDIS. The name and functionality was spawned completely from
                    the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=4&amp;p=001057">Chicago
                        Overcoat</a>, which was the name of Mobster Kingpin&#8217;s flying pirate ship/office. Chicago
                    Overcoat is also mobster slang for a coffin, therefore a Cairo Overcoat must refer to a Sarcophagus.
                    (Which also happens to have a Terminator skull over the Pharaoh&#8217;s face.) LE&#8217;s ties to
                    Egyptian lore in part trace back to a reference, through his attire obviously, to Joseph and the
                    Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, a significant part of which takes place in Egypt. Also, more vaguely,
                    the coat struck me as something that might be worn by one or more iterations of Dr. Who. And lest we
                    forget the most obvious quality of its appearance, something that could easily adorn a pimp. As with
                    many things in HS, there&#8217;s quite a slurry of references coming together to form something
                    basically ridiculous, and yet dead fucking serious. LE is many things. A time traveling crime lord
                    pimp. An omnipotent, indestructible puppet-based demon. A monster born out of an ancient, short,
                    smug, cueball-headed gunslinger, the blight of two universes by his birth alone. An Egyptian pharaoh
                    Incredible Hulk in shredded pants and suspenders with a green <a
                            href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002470">Jigsaw
                        puppet</a>-like skull for head, a gold fang, and flashing pool balls for eyes. And with his gold
                    cuestick pegleg and long coat, appears to also be somewhat reminiscent of a pirate, and may or may
                    not bear some tenuous connection to Skipper Plumbthroat, nemesis of all Squiddles, who have been
                    clearly shown to be friendly cartoon-standins for the dark gods.</p>
                <p><strong>So LE is the Hulk in suspenders with a Cal skull for a head&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;
                    really????</strong> Yes, really. I think his appearance is not what most were expecting, nor what
                    some desired, but this is a consequence of hype factor alone. It&#8217;s inevitable, keeping a
                    mystery such as this dangling out there for almost two years. People start to get attached to what
                    they envision. There is no creative advantage at all to hype. When hype is significant, you can only
                    hope to meet it at best, or more likely fall short. I felt pretty fortunate that by and large the
                    hype surrounding EOA5 was met for most people. I&#8217;m doubtful it was surpassed for many, by
                    much, considering the two month pause caused people to guess SOMETHING big was coming. Now imagine
                    instead of a two month delay, there was none at all! Bam, 13 minute animation out of nowhere. The
                    difference in reader perception in such a case is so extreme, it can&#8217;t even be communicated.
                    Conclusion: hype sux.</p>
                <p>This is exactly how I pictured LE looking before I even made the Felt intermission. I think if I
                    revealed him then, practically everyone would say, yeah that&#8217;s about right. Just a nasty,
                    monstrous looking mob boss with some gaudy accoutrements. In time, as the mystique surrounding him
                    accumulates, people get other ideas. I think some wanted a more suave motherfucker to bust onto the
                    scene, someone perhaps sleek, dapper. This doesn&#8217;t fit the concept at all, nor suits anything
                    we knew about him previously. Doc Scratch is his smooth, well mannered counterpart. He already fills
                    that role. LE as Scratch 2 is a really boring idea to me. LE as a big, no-nonsense brute,
                    functioning as Mr. Hyde to Scratch&#8217;s Dr. Jekyll, is much more interesting. (Hey, there&#8217;s
                    another bullet point for the reference slurry, if you&#8217;re taking notes, re: Jekyll/Hyde.) So
                    instead of some elegant dude too dashing for words who exploded from the screen of the yaoiest anime
                    you ever saw, he looks a bit like <a

                <p>I know, you are probably tired of waiting around for content by now, and probably aren&#8217;t
                    too psyched for another two weeks of downtime. But, there is seriously no way I can dive right
                    back into production at the moment. I have to prepare some stuff. The rapid pace of updates in
                    the past has always only been possible due to a continuously mounting stream of preparation and
                    forethought, and I have had time for neither over the past two months while dealing with this
                    animation.</p>
                <p>I WILL however plan to post a short intermission between now and then. I will let you know when
                    this date approaches.</p>
                <p>Then, when the 11th hits, we will be ready to rock again without looking back.</p></div>

                <p>Ehhh I&#8217;ve got to get back to work soon so let&#8217;s see how fast I can knock out the rest of
                    this.</p>
                <p><!-- more -->Let&#8217;s continue from the point of all the stuff about Jack&#8217;s massacre through
                    Exile Town, and address issues surrounding</p>
                <p><strong>The big chess game</strong></p>
                <p>After all this, events involving the carapace people still resemble an extremely complicated
                    interdimensional game of chess. Everything the royalty does is strategic in the bigger picture. The
                    black queen was exiled, but found another way to fulfill her role through a complex maneuver of self
                    sacrifice. The white queen&#8217;s retreat from the session, after Jack stole the black queen&#8217;s
                    ring and wrecked Prospit and the Battlefield, was a defensive regrouping strategy on post-apocalypse
                    Earth. She formed an elaborate plan, most of which went unwritten but could be understood mostly by
                    deduction. Basically, she mobilized remaining exiles there, planned to leave this universe via one
                    of the stations, destroying them all behind them to burn the bridge, but not before reuniting with
                    the king from the time capsule. She also bestowed her title as queen to PM as her successor to rule
                    the new kingdom they would build, and privately bestowed the responsibility on WV to some day wear
                    the ring and hunt down Jack, wherever he might be. The problem is, Jack short-circuited her strategy
                    by appearing immediately after the king arrived, killed WK and WQ right away, thus finally winning
                    the chess game for his kingdom, or more particularly, himself.</p>
                <p>Almost.</p>
                <p>The final gambit belonged to PM though, when she found the ring, put it on, and inherited the true
                    powers of a queen, more than just in name. Neither PM, nor any carapace creature, can literally be
                    considered a pawn. But she is pawn-like in rank, as many are in this exotic and diverse race of
                    chess people, and being the only piece left standing, she put the ring on and became the most
                    powerful type of piece possible. Much like a pawn reaching the end of a chess board, and becoming a
                    queen. For now, with her and Jack&#8217;s powers being about equal, the chess game sits in
                    stalemate.</p>
                <p><strong>God Tiers</strong></p>
                <p>First let&#8217;s look at what happened to Rose and Dave.</p>
                <p>When Rose asks Scratch whether she will reach god tier, <a
                        href=http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=005530">he responds</a>,
                </p>
                <p>You have exactly a fifty percent chance of ascending to the god tier.<br/>TT: That&#8217;s a strange
                    answer.<br/>I know.<br/>TT: Why such a precise probability?<br/>Because, much like the decisions you
                    must face to complete your dual suicide missions, you have two ways of achieving godhood to choose
                    from.<br/><br/>Which was before Jack killed her, and John revived her with a kiss, leaving only her
                    dream self. When she died, this eliminated one of the ways she could reach god tier, the only way we
                    knew of explicitly at the time. This is by having a waking self and a dream self, both alive. When
                    the waking self dies on the quest bed located somewhere on the planet, the player&#8217;s dream self
                    takes over permanently, assumes god tier status, and wakes up on the battlefield, while the waking
                    self&#8217;s corpse lies dead on the quest bed thereafter. This is how John reached god tier, and
                    how Jade did as well. (Sort of.)</p>
                <p>Dave and Rose only had one life left. They&#8217;d both been killed by Jack, and then revived as
                    their dream selves. They only had the other means of reaching god tier, which we knew little about.
                    We only had Aradia&#8217;s example to speculate from.</p>
                <p>It turns out, the other way involves another set of quest beds in the core of the moons of Prospit
                    and Derse. Reaching god tier involves using the only life you have left, and dying on that quest
                    bed. Then, rather than waking up as a god tier on the Battlefield, the dead body simply resurrects
                    automatically, transforming then and there. This is the basic outline of the process, with some
                    caveats from examples we&#8217;ve observed.</p>
                <p>Aradia was always a special case, since she was dead long before entering the session. She began the
                    session as a ghost, and then a ghost inside a robot, which never actually counted as having a living
                    waking self. She was never alive from the start, so she always only had the one ascension method
                    available to her, by the death of her dream self, which had been sleeping on its quest bed all long.
                    It was not in the core of the moon though. The moon only had five towers, because she was never a
                    living player, and didn&#8217;t &#8220;belong&#8221; with the rest of the players on her team of
                    Derse dreamers. So her dream self was sequestered away from the others, in the core of Derse. She
                    reached god tier when Jack destroyed Derse.</p>
                <p>We also can&#8217;t be sure that&#8217;s all there is to this method. Is it a simple matter of dying
                    on the bed, or is more required? In the only two examples we have of this, Aradia and Dave+Rose,
                    they die spectacularly in an explosion of green fire. Is that among the requirements? This is
                    inconclusive.</p>
                <p>Also, god tier Aradia, Dave, and Rose were all unharmed by the fire during the resurrection process.
                    Dave and Rose&#8217;s case was so extreme, they actually <em>emerged from the core of a sun</em>.
                    Does the transformation method itself protect them, until complete? Or is it just the simple matter
                    that upon transforming, they are now immortal, and dying in the very explosion leading to their
                    ascension would count as neither just nor heroic? You may speculate.</p>
                <p>After examining all that, Jade&#8217;s ascension is simple in comparison. Her dream self died, but
                    she brought it back to life by prototyping the stuffed corpse in her grandpa&#8217;s lab, making
                    Jadesprite. So, she did in fact have a living dream self, so option #1 was available. This had the
                    side effect of turbo charging her god tier state. She not only has the Witch of Space powers and
                    immortality, she merged with the sprite, which was imbued with Bec&#8217;s powers. She now has the
                    abilities of a god tier player, a sprite, and a first guardian all in one.</p>
                <p>Ironically, the green sun which they were seeking to destroy, now powers two of the heroes opposing
                    Jack: Jade and PM.</p>
                <p><strong>The Scratch</strong></p>
                <p>This is all pretty straightforward. We saw John at the beginning, fighting very strong monsters on
                    the Beat Mesa, and initiating the Scratch with a giant Quill of Echidna, just as he was <a
                            href=http://www.mspaintadventures.com/scratch.php?s=6&amp;p=005766">instructed
                        to by Karkat</a>. He killed the monsters easily with lava tornadoes and his Pop-a-matic
                    Vrillyhoo Hammer, completed the full jagged mark across the record&#8217;s surface, and the whole
                    Beat Mesa took off towards Skaia. It was releasing its energy the whole time, causing the Medium to
                    crackle with that background energy you saw so often. Before it could get to Skaia, Jade teleported
                    him to her ship. Once it entered Skaia, it fully released its temporal energy, and caused the hard
                    reset, totally wiping out the session. But not before Jade collected all the planets, the
                    Battlefield, and John on her Propitian battleship, and flew through a gigantic 4th wall.</p>
                <p><strong>The 4th Wall</strong></p>
                <p>First of all, she didn&#8217;t actually conjure the 4th wall out of thin air. Remember when Karkat
                    told her to <a href=http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=005152">turn
                        the wall off</a>, and then <a
                            href=http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=005153">draw it</a>?
                    He was asking her to captchalogue an undamaged copy using her Pictionary modus, for this exact
                    purpose. The eventual getaway. So she had it on standby, waiting for the right time to use it.</p>
                <p>As she expanded it, and we crept ever closer to the completion of the scratch, we saw individual
                    panels from early in the story flashing backwards. From a visualization standpoint, this is just
                    reminding us that the scratch is in fact undoing everything we just read, all the way back to page
                    one, and starting over fresh in a different instantiation of the universe. But if you want to
                    understand why all that was literally being broadcast through the wall at that moment, you could
                    consider what happened to be on the other side of the wall: <a
                            href=http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=005130">Lord English&#8217;s
                        coat</a>. Why would the interior of the coat broadcast those flashbacks? No need to get into it
                    too much. Suffice to say, it belongs to someone purported to be a master of time.</p>
                <p>Will the coat still be there the moment they crash through the glass? Recall that this is all
                    happening &#8220;simultaneously&#8221; with the rest of the critical moment, which is the juncture
                    that summons him. When he is summoned, he may need his coat. Whether he retrieves it or not, we&#8217;ll
                    just have to see.</p>
                <p>What&#8217;s waiting for them on the other side, beside a big ugly coat? Recall the setup I had with
                    the <a href=http://www.mspaintadventures.com/scratch.php?s=6&amp;p=005933">two
                        4th walls facing each other, separated by one yard</a>. They will break through the wall on the
                    right, traveling nearly the speed of light, and presumably, break through the wall on the left to
                    enter another reality. If you were thorough during <a
                            href=http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=005595">Seer:
                        Descend</a>, you might have caught this excerpt on a bookshelf. &#8220;Though we adore Him we
                    shall never enjoy His beauteous Croak. We spill our blood on acres of black and white so they may
                    cross the yellow yard. At last in Skaia&#8217;s reflection through broken glass He may find the pond
                    in which He&#8217;s meant to squat.&#8221;</p>
                <p>The yellow yard, regarding <a
                        href=http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=005558">my self indulgent
                    spiel</a> about the degree of author intervention to expect, very simply refers to the physical
                    distance between the two 4th walls the heroes will pass through, to escape from a doomed reality
                    into one of promise. The heroes will coexist with me, the author, for the span of three feet, and
                    while traveling very quickly, for the duration of thee nanoseconds. This was always my tongue in
                    cheek way of quantifiably demonstrating the absolute minimum degree of influence an author insert
                    can have on the story, while not having none. It&#8217;s essentially a gag, but serving a practical
                    purpose in the story, and a very concrete, understandable mechanism by which they may hop between
                    realities.</p>
                <p>I am also pretending that my personal interaction with Doc Scratch doesn&#8217;t count as influencing
                    the story directly. It&#8217;s influencing the way the story is told, which after all, is what
                    authors tend to do.</p>

                    question was probably the most maddening of the bunch for a long time. The bloody hand was first
                    shown in Jade: Enter, and as Jack&#8217;s list of victims grew, his hand continued to be clean. The
                    list of possibilities kept narrowing, until we finally found out here, along with an answer to

                    ways available, by riding a meteor through a portal back to Earth. The meteor was the one host to
                    the frog ruins, and he tucked himself in the same time capsule the White King did not too long ago.
                    The meteor crashed on prehistoric Earth, formed the ruins, and waited about 413 million years. Then
                    the king came out of the capsule to greet the queen. Jack followed about ten seconds later to their
                    surprise, and killed them immediately. He exited the ruins, and AR began detonating the four
                    stations. These were rigged presumably as part of the exiles&#8217; unspoken plan, as a failsafe to
                    prevent Jack from doing just this, in case he found his way there. AR hesitated to blow up WV&#8217;s
                    station, because he knew WV was still trapped inside. At this pause, Jack killed AR, and quickly
                    entered the final remaining station to investigate, while (foolishly, it turns out) dismissing PM as
                    irrelevant.</p>
                <p>In the station, he found <a
                        href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003311">this device</a>,
                    which had been switched to the left side of the frog with the <a
                            href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=005166">queen&#8217;s
                        key</a>, most likely by the queen at an earlier point. Thus it would transport the user to the
                    session outside this universe, i.e. the troll session, as opposed to the one inside it, the kid
                    session. But it was out of power, and had been ever since <a
                            href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002657">WV flew the
                        station halfway around the world to find the ruins</a>. So Jack, looking for a power source,
                    located the uranium in WV&#8217;s belly, probably via his keen sense of smell as an omnipotent dog.
                    He ripped the uranium out of a hapless WV&#8217;s gut, thus bloodying his hand. He powered the
                    station, which both opened its hatch, and allowed him to flee from yet another doomed reality. He
                    likely knew he couldn&#8217;t stay in that universe for long, since he recognized the red miles
                    destroying it above. But he probably didn&#8217;t understand that would be his own doing from
                    outside the universe, hours in his future.</p>
                <p>Jack, bloody hand and all, then appeared in the troll session just as the trolls were about to enter
                    the universe they created, as we saw in <a
                            href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=004827">Jade:
                        Enter</a>. He then went on his murderous rampage through their session, some of which we saw in
                    quick replays during this animation. He destroyed all 12 planets, Prospit, Derse, and finally,
                    turned his red miles attack on Bilious Slick, destroying the very universe he just narrowly escaped
                    from. And in doing so, he contributed his share to the critical moment. His alternate session self,
                    Spades Slick, contributed the other part by killing Snowman, &#8220;simultaneously.&#8221; All of
                    Act 5 could be subtitled &#8220;Jack Noir Kills Everybody&#8221; and that&#8217;s pretty much the
                    guiding principle I had in structuring it from the start. Jack Noir has killed every major
                    character, in one way or another (with maybe a few exceptions, like PM), including the entire
                    population of two universes.</p>
                <p>Then, finally, as he viewed the aftermath of Bilious Slick&#8217;s destruction in Skaia&#8217;s
                    water-sphere, and noticed the green sun appearing in the distance, he saw PM enter with WV&#8217;s
                    body on the frog platform, the same way Jack arrived about 10 hours prior. After he left the desert,
                    she went into the now-open station, and dragged WV&#8217;s body to safety, away from the bombs, but
                    was faced with the universe&#8217;s imminent destruction overhead. She noticed WV had dropped the
                    ring he&#8217;d been hiding all along, so she put it on and assumed all of Jack&#8217;s powers.
                    Then, again probably due to enhanced canine tracking abilities, immediately knew where to follow
                    Jack. She brought WV, likely with the hope that he may survive, as well as his firefly Serenity, and
                    is now prepared for a duel.</p>
                <p><strong>Slick kills Snowman</strong></p>
                <p>It was established in the intermission that <a
                        href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003168">when Snowman dies,
                    the universe is destroyed</a>. (Relating of course to her 8-ball theme, and billiards rules
                    involving pocketing that ball, or scratching while pocketing it.) Hence, when Slick shoots her
                    through the heart with Scratch&#8217;s single-cueball-bullet-firing gun, the trolls&#8217; universe
                    (blue) comes to an end. Recall that <a
                            href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/scratch.php?s=6&amp;p=005769">Scratch
                        browbeat Slick into agreeing to take his gun and kill her</a>. With nothing in particular left
                    to lose, or live for, Slick complied, and more than likely took enjoyment from settling this old
                    score, even though it meant his own death too. Note that during the standoff, it seemed Snowman
                    welcomed the attack. This was, after all, the culmination of her role, both as the black queen, and
                    as a servant of Lord English.</p>
                <p>As the black queen of Derse, her basic role is to oppose creation. She wars with Prospit, and stands
                    in the way of the heroes who seek to create a universe. Since she was exiled from the session, she
                    could no longer fulfill that role. So she was offered another way, by Doc Scratch, in an agreement
                    of mutual interest. Since she couldn&#8217;t oppose the creation of a new universe, she could
                    facilitate the destruction of another. Scratch gave the queen the powers of Snowman, and bound her
                    life in some mysterious way to the troll universe itself (turning the typically red blood of a queen
                    to blue, the color signifying that universe). Which is of course, another giant frog much like the
                    one Jack killed, which we have never seen from the outside. Ironically, to fulfill her role, she was
                    bound to the life of a creature she loathed, <a
                            href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=004207">which happened
                        once before</a> in the troll session when they prototyped a frog. She was disgusted by the
                    transformation, and removed the ring, which lead to her eventual exile, and <a
                            href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=004211">meeting with
                        Scratch in the desert</a>.</p>
                <p>Her role as Snowman also suited Lord English&#8217;s purposes, as her death provided the mechanism
                    for his entrance, as well as contributed to the creation of the green sun. This appears to be a
                    pattern with LE, enslaving various women, who can only die by completing their term of service, and
                    vice versa. He recruited <a
                            href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/scratch.php?s=6&amp;p=005971">Aradia&#8217;s
                        and Feferi&#8217;s ancestors</a> in the same way. From the perspective of LE as a crime boss
                    rather than an immortal demon, he&#8217;s somewhat like a ruthless pimp. Whoever he is. This is one
                    of the few major questions lingering, in case you didn&#8217;t notice.</p>
                <p>Anyway, more to talk about, but enough words for now.</p>

                <p>Now to address the substance of the animation.</p>
                <p>It is not only long, it is dense. As dense as most other animations, while subjecting you to many
                    more raw minutes of this rapid fire data. The events are portrayed nonlinearly. They shift focus
                    between different sessions, planets, and universes, zooming into and out of them, showing them
                    shrink, teleport, or explode spectacularly. We jump to points in a character&#8217;s chronology in
                    the future, in the past, and examine frames of reference where chronology has no meaning. This
                    animation is cerebrally challenging to follow. But your understanding of it will be in direct
                    proportion to how well you understood the whole story up to this point. If you followed everything,
                    and remember the key facts, there&#8217;s a very good chance you understood everything in the
                    animation easily.</p>
                <p>So, let&#8217;s take a closer look at what there is to understand.</p>
                <!-- more -->
                <p>Might as well start with the biggest development.</p>
                <p><strong>The tumor was a bomb that physically contained both our universe (red side) and the troll
                    universe (blue side). It was counting down to the &#8220;simultaneous&#8221; destruction of both
                    universes. On detonation, it did not destroy the green sun as intended. It created it.</strong></p>
                <p>I believe some people thought they were witnessing the destruction of the sun when the bomb went off.
                    Though if you examine the scene objectively, there&#8217;s no reason to think this, other than that
                    it was the stated mission for so long. There was no sun in sight. They were drifting through empty
                    space. Then, boom. The sun was growing from ground zero. The fact that this misapprehension was
                    somewhat common probably speaks to how cemented the mission to destroy the sun had become as a
                    critical plot point. And maybe also, to how well Scratch deceived everyone on the subject.</p>
                <p>All of act 5, and to some extent all of Homestuck, has been the result of a very, very long con by
                    Doc Scratch. His power source, and the source that fueled all this calamity in many other ways, was
                    always going to be created in this way, by combined efforts of the kids and the trolls to save
                    reality. Part of his job was to make sure that happened. That was the secret part of his job. The
                    other part, openly stated, was to pave the way for the entrance of his master, which is triggered on
                    the destruction of the troll universe, as illustrated by <a
                            href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003991">this virus</a>.
                    It turns out that doing these two things is one and the same. No green sun without the death of a
                    universe. No Lord English either.</p>
                <p>You may retrace his conversations in light of this new fact. He says he never lies, and while he&#8217;s
                    certainly deceptive, I think you are hard pressed to find him saying something that is absolutely
                    untrue. He misdirects, and lies by omission (which is something he makes clear he doesn&#8217;t
                    believe in). But just about everything he says can be validated in some way. There are clues to this
                    outcome everywhere, hiding in plain sight.</p>
                <p>Consider his conversation <a
                        href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=005531">here</a>. He
                    speaks primarily in hypotheticals, about what would happen if they destroyed the sun. He says things
                    often arranged like this: &#8220;And it is certainly true that The Tumor you will deliver to its
                    location has enough power to destroy it completely.&#8221; He says they will deliver the bomb to the
                    sun&#8217;s location. He just doesn&#8217;t mention the sun won&#8217;t be there yet. He also says
                    its powerful enough to destroy it, hypothetically. Also true. He just doesn&#8217;t mention it won&#8217;t
                    be around to destroy, until the bomb goes off!</p>
                <p>There&#8217;s also <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=004941">this
                    tidbit</a>. &#8220;<span>TT: It is nearly twice the mass of our universe.</span>&#8221; Because it
                    is literally comprised of the detonated mass of two dead universes. And so on.</p>
                <p>Next up. Even though this isn&#8217;t a &#8220;revelation&#8221;, it should probably be bolded and
                    discussed.</p>
                <p><strong>Time and space do not work comprehensibly in the furthest ring.</strong></p>
                <p>How can the sun just have been created, when it was there all along, fueling Bec and Doc Scratch for
                    ages, and more recently, Bec Noir, Jadesprite, etc? See above.</p>
                <p><span>TT: The greater the distance you travel through it, the less reliably time flows.</span>
                    <br/><span>TT: And the more time you spend in it, the less reliably space behaves.</span>
                    <br/><span>TT: Time and space aren&#8217;t as different as you might think.</span></p>
                <p>So in other words, what really happened is Rose and Dave&#8217;s journey took them quite a distance
                    through the furthest ring. The longer they traveled, the less reliably you could place them on the
                    timeline. They may have traveled a few miles, while simultaneously wandering millions of years into
                    the future. And after another few miles, may have gone eons into the past, way before the green sun
                    existed. This is in fact what happened. The dark gods helped chart their course through this
                    spacetime maze to deliver them to this location, at this time. Take that for what you will.</p>
                <p>This is also at the heart of why the sun became visible to the trolls the moment it did, rather than
                    always being visible. It is not because it &#8220;just happened&#8221;, since the respective
                    timeframes are incompatible, and that notion doesn&#8217;t actually make sense. The moment of
                    Bilious Slick&#8217;s detonation (our universe), that was the moment the light from the green sun&#8217;s
                    ancient explosion finally managed to reach their session, after its long circuitous travel through
                    knotted spacetime. In fact, we don&#8217;t even need a complex spacetime model to understand this.
                    Right now, there is celestial phenomena happening in our universe that we cannot see, because the
                    light hasn&#8217;t reached us yet! It won&#8217;t for millions of years.</p>
                <p>The light from the sun is important to the trolls not only as a beacon, but as a momentary
                    illumination of a &#8220;straight line&#8221; through the furthest ring. If light can make it from
                    here to there through the broken space, then so can a meteor, as long as it travels fast and doesn&#8217;t
                    miss the opportunity. This is a decent reason for the urgent getaway, as well as, presumably, the
                    need to escape Jack&#8217;s ire while he is distracted. So Sollux went all out, putting a little
                    extra mustard on it so to speak, and reprised his ill fated ancestor&#8217;s role as <a
                            href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/scratch.php?s=6&amp;p=005960">helmsman</a>.
                </p>
                <p>Aradia&#8217;s chronology is also worth noting. She is not actually witnessing the birth of the sun,
                    as this (remember, nonlinear) animation seems to illustrate. When she <a
                            href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=005466">flew inside
                        Jack</a> to escape, the sun was already there waiting for her. Every time we have seen Aradia
                    hanging out in front of the sun, or <a
                            href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/scratch.php?s=6&amp;p=005898">hanging
                        out with Sollux&#8217;s (half-)ghost</a>, that was well after the sun was created.</p>
                <p><span>AA: i am waiting for friends to arrive</span> <br/><span>AA: they will need my help</span>
                    <br/><span>TA: what friends?</span> <br/><span>TA: m0re ghosts?</span> <br/><span>AA: no theyre alive</span>
                    <br/><span>AA: first</span> <br/><span>AA: there will be two humans</span> <br/><span>AA: they should be joining us any minute</span>
                </p>
                <p>She&#8217;s of course referring to Rose and Dave. And of course, at the time, we&#8217;re meant to
                    believe they will arrive in the moon they are piloting, ready to crash kamikaze style into the sun
                    and blow it up. There&#8217;s little reason to question this. But it turns out all along, she was
                    waiting for them to COME OUT of the sun! As freshly minted god tiers. The nonlinear flow of the
                    story was at every turn directing you away from the suspicion that their mission would create the

                <p>I think that&#8217;s enough to digest for now. I&#8217;ll make another part later, talking about some
                    other aspects of the Flash, like Jack&#8217;s convoluted inter-session journey, the scratch, the
                    expanding 4th wall and all that stuff.</p></div>

            <div class="title">About EOA5, part 1</div>
            <div class="copy">
                <p>First, I&#8217;ll go into the process, and all the technical stuff about making it. It ended up being
                    around 13 and a half minutes, about 50&#160;MB, was split up into 5 separate Flash files strung
                    together by a loader, and used around a thousand art assets, not counting those imported from old
                    animations. Following about a 2 week break starting 8/22 to take care of other things, I started
                    more serious work on it, and took about 6 weeks to finish it.</p>
                <p><!-- more -->It was more than 3 times as long as Descend (the end of act 4) which was previously the
                    longest animation. But it took about six times as long to make! So, why so long? Let&#8217;s look at
                    some reasons.</p>
                <p>1) COLLABORATION OVERLOAD! - First of all, I think all the contributed art is amazing, and I&#8217;m
                    ecstatic with the overall look of the integrated results. But as strange and unintuitive as it
                    sounds, getting so many people to pitch in to such a big project actually delayed the process
                    non-trivially. I didn&#8217;t really anticipate the challenges of managing a project of this size. I
                    spent a lot of time up front planning, organizing, dividing things up into tasks, and communicating
                    with many artists individually. This is overhead that is normally negligible for smaller projects,
                    where I usually just charge right in and begin animating. Then, after distributing the work, there&#8217;s
                    the inevitable waiting game, while assets started coming back to me in pretty much random order,
                    which makes for a scheduling conundrum. There is also the need to process the graphics to be
                    suitable for animation, make little fixes and touches, or sometimes redo graphics completely if I
                    didn&#8217;t quite convey the requirements properly. None of this is in play when I work solo. I
                    generally draw fast, know exactly what&#8217;s necessary for the Flash, take just the right
                    shortcuts on graphics, format them right from the getgo, and drop them on the timeline. But on the
                    flipside, the contributors generally can take the time to render lovely backdrops and character
                    portraits that I wouldn&#8217;t bother with on my own, for the sake of speed. This is a big plus I
                    think.</p>
                <p>So the bottom line is, distributing work for a project of this size will cause the project to a) look
                    better, but b) take longer. That said, looking back, I don&#8217;t think I would change anything
                    about the approach. It looks great, and the time it took overall was worth it. I&#8217;d only revise
                    my scheduling estimates.</p>
                <p>2) FLASH SUCKS! - Flash is not good at handling big animations. At all. I tried doing what I usually
                    do, putting everything in one file, and hoping for the best. After about 7 minutes of completed
                    animation, it started locking up constantly. I tried a lot of things, splitting it up into different
                    scenes within the same file. Didn&#8217;t work. The Flash file ultimately caved in on itself, and
                    became corrupted. Luckily I saved backups, and tried a different approach.</p>
                <p>I just split it up into five different Flash files, published them separately, and strung them all
                    together through a loader file, which worked, but invited its own series of debugging headaches.
                    After half way through the animation, I was CONSTANTLY putting out technical fires with respect to
                    Flash. I&#8217;d say I probably lost two weeks to problems like this, which have been a total non
                    factor in previous projects, aside from the first few when I was actually learning how to use
                    it.</p>
                <p>The good news is I won&#8217;t repeat these mistakes in the future, and will know how to approach a
                    project of this size more efficiently. The good-slash-bad news is this shouldn&#8217;t be an issue.
                    I don&#8217;t see myself doing another animation this long for the rest of the series. Not even
                    close, in fact. This was, in terms of cinematic gravitas, the high point of the series. It&#8217;s
                    the conclusion to act five which all the setup demanded. It is the BIG ONE. A challenge I set out to
                    do, for as much as any other reason, to see if I could.</p>
                <p>ABOUT MUSIC</p>
                <p>I decided to use Tensei&#8217;s &#8220;Cascade&#8221; as the theme around which the EOA5 score would
                    be arranged a long time ago. Before he even made his <a
                            href="http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/album/strife">solo album</a>,
                    actually. I stuck with that idea through most of act 5.2. In fact, it exists in the first 1/3 of the
                    score largely unedited. There were a few alterations for the sake of keying to specific visuals,
                    like a significantly extended part, and the end was truncated to move on to the next theme. (I
                    believe the original is a bonus song in <a
                            href="http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/album/homestuck-vol-8">Volume 8</a>)
                </p>
                <p>All the editing was done by Toby Fox, who I worked closely with on piecing together the whole score,
                    which adhered to a strict timetable of visual events. I gave him duration figures, cited timestamps
                    on clips, and so on, and he worked with my mad instructions to craft something that functions very
                    well as a score to the events I had in mind. This is the opposite of how it usually works. Usually I
                    take a song that&#8217;s ready to go, and animate events to that song. Obviously there was no 13
                    minute song lying around, so some custom work had to be done. This was done, most speedily, in the
                    form of an extended medley, drifting in and out of different themes to suit the current action. Sort
                    of like an expanded expression of the EOA&#8217;s predecessor, <a
                            href="http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/descend">Descend</a>, which
                    was Toby&#8217;s composition I adapted for that purpose, thinking of scenes to suit the music. But
                    it was the other way around this time. Working on the music in this way likely also contributed to
                    the delay.</p>
                <p>The aim was not to produce a totally cohesive, air tight composition to stand alone necessarily. The
                    focus was on making a strong score. Concerns for scoring are very different from those for
                    standalone composition. Emphasis has to be placed on serving visuals, even at the expense of more
                    sensible composition practices sometimes, to set tone, fit the timing and such. So that&#8217;s what
                    we did, and that was behind my thinking in piecing together the various songs I did. Like the second
                    segment, Clark Powell&#8217;s <a
                            href="http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/flare">Flare</a>, edited by
                    Toby to fit the time allotted, and accelerate into the Snowman faceoff. And two pieces by Malcolm
                    Brown, who accounted for a big chunk of the overall composition time. <a
                            href="http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/savior-of-the-dreaming-dead">Savior
                        of the Dreaming Dead</a>, largely unedited besides transitions, and a custom remix I asked him
                    to do of <a href="http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/black-rose-green-sun">Black
                        Rose / Green Sun</a> to finish it, which turned out awesome, especially after a few more touches
                    by Toby &amp; co.</p>
                <p>Another couple facts to point out.</p>
                <p>- The breaks occasionally in the music are not necessarily unprompted aesthetic decisions. They
                    resulted from the fact that I had to chop the thing up into five parts, and switching between them
                    would invariably lead to sound skipping. So to account for this, we made the breaks as creatively
                    deliberate as possible. Like that gap of silence just before we start following Rose and Dave. Or
                    the silence when zooming out of LOFAF, into Skaia, then firing it back up on the Battlefield. And,
                    obviously, the dramatic pause before the bomb goes off. I&#8217;m calling this an art through
                    adversity situation.</p>
                <p>- I never give anyone, artist or musician, any more information than they need to know. Like I&#8217;m
                    not saying to Toby, &#8220;ok here&#8217;s where Slick faces Snowman and shoots her through the
                    heart, we&#8217;re gonna need something badass for that.&#8221; I give more open instruction. I say,
                    &#8220;I think the music should start speeding up here, and get a little heavier&#8230; maybe begin
                    quoting that piano from Flare at a lower register?&#8221; and notes of that sort. Then he makes
                    sense of it. As silly as it sounds, I don&#8217;t like spoiling stuff even for people working on it.
                    I&#8217;d rather leave as much a surprise for them too. Also, I&#8217;m always skeptical that giving
                    the contributors the full picture would actually improve the product. The process is more
                    interesting this way.</p></div>

                    not sure about the timing on this. I can&#8217;t go into more details on the solution than that
                    yet.</p>
                <p>I&#8217;ve heard many alternative suggestions and will probably continue to. To field a few of
                    them:</p>
                <p>1) I&#8217;m not going to host it on youtube. Or render it in video format at all. I don&#8217;t want
                    it to be a video. I want it to be Flash. If I thought I was going to end up rendering a video, I
                    would have planned the project for video output accordingly. Perhaps used After Effects. It&#8217;s
                    a completely different kind of media. This option is not going to happen.</p>
                <p>2) You may &#8220;know a guy&#8221; with hosting to spare, or such. While it&#8217;s a nice thought,
                    there&#8217;s a 99.99% chance his server can&#8217;t handle it. It&#8217;s a big file, and there&#8217;ll
                    be upwards of 2 million people looking at it at once. This will use more bandwidth in one day than
                    most high traffic comics use in a year. Sorry, but thanks for the offer.</p>
                <p>3) Amazon S3, etc? I&#8217;ve looked into a bunch of things like this. It&#8217;s expensive. Under
                    usual circumstances, it costs several thousand dollars every month to host MSPA. And I&#8217;m fine
                    with floating that cost myself, from ad revenue and sales, and making the business side of things
                    work to sustain it. This is a little different. A conservative estimate has the cost at $10K for one
                    day. This is not considering excessive page reloads, the aftershocks of hosting it for the following
                    weeks, or an unanticipated viral explosion beyond the already high expected traffic. Could be
                    anywhere from $10K to $100K to host this one stupid file, which is bankruptcy territory. It&#8217;s
                    not worth that to put out a little free entertainment, frankly. If I posted that kind of content for
                    such an audience every month, I&#8217;d find some business strategy to make that work. But I&#8217;m
                    not there yet. Also, I&#8217;m not gonna do some sort of fund drive to finance this either. I&#8217;m
                    sure that would produce some results, but it just doesn&#8217;t sit well with me as the answer.</p>
                <p>So I&#8217;m working on more creative alternatives for handling this. I&#8217;ll let you know.</p>
                <p>edit: Torrenting, megadownloading, etc are in reserve as last resort plans. It would be more ideal to
                    find a way to run on site though. We&#8217;ll see.</p></div>

            <div class="copy"><p>Because formspring is terrible. I discontinued my account. (Again.)</p>
                <p>Not only was it poorly organized and difficult to use, I think it lent the false appearance that it
                    was a viable way to get in touch with me. And a lot of people treated it that way. But it really
                    wasn&#8217;t. Many thousands of submitted questions went unread. It was not possible to keep up with
                    them.</p>
                <p>So I guess tumblr it is, because it seems to be the blogging software du jour? Basically I type stuff
                    and it appears on the internet. Sounds good to me. Then you can &#8220;like&#8221; it a million
                    times and chuck my posts into the furious echo chamber of reblogged material. Kind of like putting
                    my words out to stud with the memes, where they will be mounted inappropriately in front of
                    youngsters. Is that how this works? Yes.</p>
